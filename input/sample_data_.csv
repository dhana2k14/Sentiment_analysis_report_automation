"Vigor Chooses ABB Battery Electric Power For New Ferries In Washington July 2nd, 2020 by Steve Hanley The State of Washington operates the one of the largest ferry fleets in world. Visitors to the Seattle area are well familiar with the sight of its green and white ferries crisscrossing Puget Sound all day every day, almost all of them powered by diesel engines. Combined, they suck down about 20 million gallons of diesel fuel a year, which means they are spewing enormous amounts of carbon dioxide and particulate matter in their wake. Under the leadership of Washington Governor Jay Inslee  one of the few political leaders in the US who takes climate change seriously  the management of the state ferry system has made a serious commitment to reducing pollution from its ferries by converting some existing vessels to electric power and calling for any new ferries to be primarily battery electric vessels. Ian Sterling, a public information officer for Washington State Ferries, told Greentech Media at the end of last year, The government-owned ferry operators annual fuel consumption is on par with that of a midsize airline, making it the states biggest diesel polluter. He added the switch to batteries is not just because the governor said [to do] it. Even if youre not an environmentalist, this is a good idea for the taxpayer because we expect it to pay for itself relatively quickly, based on the price of fuel. It saves millions of dollars annually. The ferry operator has begun converting three of its Jumbo Mark II ferries to electricity. Those three vessels alone consume 5 million gallons of fuel a year. Each of them will have two of its four diesel generators and locomotive engines replaced with battery systems supplied by Siemens. Now Vigor Shipyards, which builds vessels in the Pacific Northwest, has been awarded a contract to build new battery-powered Olympic class ferries for the state of Washington. The first of the new vessels is scheduled to enter service in 2024. Each will have a capacity of 144 cars and 1,500 passengers. This landmark project supports Washington States goal for 2050 to reduce emissions by 57.5 per cent below the emissions level in 2019, utilising a hybrid and electric propulsion solution that is space-efficient, easy to install and flexible in operation, Jay Hebert, vice president of marine fabrication at Vigor, tells Cruise and Ferry magazine. Vigor is delighted to partner with ABB in this remarkable work prompted by the commitment of Washington Governor Jay Inslee, the state legislature and Washington State Ferries to replace aging ferries with clean technology in alignment with the states commitment to environmental stewardship, he added. By 2040, the ferry service expects to replace 13 of its current ships with vessels that operate primarily on electricity (they will have diesel engines as a backup power source) and convert 6 more ferries to become plug-in hybrid vessels, saving more than 10 million gallons of diesel fuel from being burned each year. The electrification project will require the installation of high power chargers at the ferry terminals where the electric ships will dock. Moving towards a zero emission future relies on technologies that meet the environmental and cost needs of today and offer flexibility to integrate future energy sources in the years ahead, says Juha Koskela, managing director of ABB Marine & Ports. ABB is delighted to support this milestone project demonstrating the way that electric, digital and connected solutions can deliver shippings zero-emission future. Seattle joins several other ferry services in Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and elsewhere that are transitioning from diesel ferries to electric or hybrid electric ferries in order to lower costs and reduce emissions from the vessels they operate. Saving the planet is nice, but doing it in a way that saves companies and taxpayers money is even better. Support CleanTechnica with Just $3/Month Advertisement from Google:

"The Board of Directors of Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (CPCL) has recommended to the Board of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL), its holding company, investment approval for the construction of the 9 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) refinery at its Cauvery Basin Refinery (CBR) in Nagapattinam. The project will help increase the refining capacity in Tamil Nadu and ensure uninterrupted supplies to the southern parts of the State and neighbouring States. It will also aid in economic development of these areas. CPCL has also notified the National Stock Exchange of its boards recommendation for the project that would be a joint venture between IOCL and CPCL, where the two companies would hold 25% of shares each. The balance would be held by financial or strategic or public investors who would be identified later. The project would cost an estimated ?28,980 crore, said a company source. Now, the investment proposal awaits the approval of the board of the IOCL. The environmental clearance for the project is awaited. As far land acquisition, a team of Revenue Department officials, formed by the Tamil Nadu government, has started its work, said a company official. CPCL already owns 650 acres in the area since the CBR had been functioning there with a capacity of one MMTPA. The first-stage approval for the project was received from CPCL/IOCL Boards in September 2017. Subsequently, selection of technology and preparation of process packages were completed. A detailed feasibility report has also been completed. The company has plans to install a single-point mooring to source crude oil for the project. Crude oil will be transported to the refinery through a pipeline from the mooring. The bulk of the refined products will be despatched through a cross-country pipeline to Tiruchi, and the balance through coastal evacuation using nearby port facilities. CPCLs refinery at Manali has a refining capacity of 10.5 MMPTA. Its products include fuel, wax, naphtha and LPG. The CBR was set up in 1993 with a capacity of .5 MMPTA, which was later enhanced to 1 MMPTA. The refinery at the CBR is being replaced with a state-of-the- art refinery of 9 MMTPA.

"Billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) plans to increase its network of aviation fuel stations by 50 per cent as it looks to capture greater market share in the business currently controlled by public sector oil retailing firms. In its latest annual report, RIL said the double-digit growth observed over 52 consecutive months might have been stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but India continues to be one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world for the fifth consecutive year. RIL, which operates the worlds largest single location oil refining complex, plans to capture this opportunity through increased presence at airports to refuel airplanes.Air-passenger traffic in India rose 9 per cent even in February after the Indian carriers recouped to full capacity that was lowered following the closure of a major domestic carrier in the first few months of financial year 2019-20 (April 2019 to March 2020) as well as disruptions at Mumbai airport owing to construction and maintenance, it said. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, while travel restrictions were being imposed elsewhere, India was largely unaffected till the end of March 2020, before the sharp escalation in travel bans globally and lockdowns impacted Indias aviation sector too. On account of its network strength, cost competitiveness, industry leading technology and best-in-class service standards, RIL improved its volume share in the domestic market, according to the annual report.

"German engineering company Siemens saw the volume of business contract by as much as 20 per cent in the three months to June and activity in 2021 would stay below 2019 levels, the chief financial officer told Boersenzeitung (BoeZ). Ralf Thomas told Saturday's edition of the newspaper that the company's financial third quarter, which runs April to June, ""will be a big challenge for us, as for most other market participants as well"" due to the coronavirus crisis. ""However, it will not be a bottomless fall,"" he said, adding that the business volume of short-cycle activities had likely contracted by between 10 per cent and 20 per cent in the period. Thomas had said in May he expected a 5 per cent drop in revenue in the financial year ending in September, after guiding for moderate sales growth before the virus outbreak. He did not rule out moves to cut capacity in some business areas, but left open where this could be. He said activity in 2021 would not reach 2019's level across all businesses or regions, but said Siemens had a competitive advantage over rivals in some areas, without offering details.

"An extension of the best-selling Terra range, the new 180kW Terra 184 is the most compact high-power charger with the highest power density on the market According to the UN, cities are responsible for more than 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions1 and by 2050 are expected to be home to more than two thirds of the worlds population2. It is, therefore, vital that these rapidly expanding urban hubs take proactive steps to reduce their carbon emissions and e-mobility is a key factor in achieving this. But for e-mobility to be viable in high density cities, where time is short and space is at a premium, solutions must be developed which address these challenges. ABBs latest evolution in charging technology does just that. The Terra 184 charger, the latest member of ABBs best-selling Terra family of chargers, is fast, compact, robust and provides the ability to charge up to three vehicles simultaneously3, maximizing convenience for drivers and revenue for the charging operator. With a charging power of 180kW, the Terra 184 can be used by vehicles of all sizes, be it latest or future generation private cars, buses or trucks. But unlike other high-power chargers, it comes with a footprint of less than 0.5m2, the same as the current Terra 54 model. Indeed, its innovative design means there is no need for separately installed power cabinets, offering the perfect fast and compact solution for cities with limited space. Over the last decade, ABB has laid the foundation for the future of sustainable transportation. With our latest extension to the Terra range, we have delivered against the demands, both in terms of the needs of urban areas and of the electric vehicles which frequent their roads, said Frank Muehlon, Head of ABBs global business for E-mobility Infrastructure Solutions. The Terra 184 supports all the charging standards on the market, including CCS, CHAdeMO and AC, and caters to the needs of all batteries up to 920V. It is highly customizable with features including customized credit card payment terminal, screen and cables, which have also been designed at 8 meters for maximum charging convenience. For added flexibility, operators of other Terra models such as the Terra 94 or 124, can in the future chose to upgrade their charging solution to the Terra 184 with the addition of extra power modules. The Terra 184 will be available direct from ABB and via selected ABB distributors in Europe from July, North America from August and the rest of the world by the fourth quarter of this year. It offers a safe, smart and sustainable charging solution which supports ABB Electrifications Mission to Zero, a vision for a zero-emission reality for all.

"Bharat Petroleum's Corporate Research & Development Centre (CRDC) has bagged as many as 62 patents since its inception 19 years ago and is awaiting 68 more. Since its establishment in July 2001, CRDC has developed a bouquet of innovations, bagging as many as 62 patents from the country as well as abroad, including the US and Europe, and 68 more are pending for approvals. ""Of the total patented innovations, around 20 are already commercialised and are deployed at various BPCL facilities,"" Sanjay Bhargava, executive director and chief of CRDC, told PTI over phone from New Delhi. Within the next one month they will be filing for five-six patents as well, he added. The centre, with an annual budget of Rs 80-100 crore, has published 141 research articles and its innovations are cited in five books, Bhargava said. CRDC, recognised by the Department of Scientific & Industrial Research, has been set up with a mission to transform ideas into innovations. Some of the notable patented innovations are BPMarrk, which is an intelligent tool for advanced assaying of crude oils, which characterises and evaluates crudes at a fraction of the time taken by traditional assaying methods that take a month at least. ""BPMarrk drastically slashes the time required to generate results from three to four weeks to merely one hour. This is patented in India, the US, Europe and Africa,"" Bhargava said. Another patented innovation is the K-Model, a software for quick and accurate prediction of crude oils' blend compatibility and blend optimisation that are generated within minutes compared to a traditional process that takes several weeks. The K-Model is getting completed for commercial deployment at a private refinery and is being contract manufactured by a Baroda-based company, he said. Bharat GSR CAT is a high-performance catalyst for reduction of sulphur in gasoline. This is the world's first catalyst prepared from fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) spent catalyst. The novel catalyst is only one-third the cost of imported alternatives, he said. Bharat Ecochem is a patented fuel additive that protects the metallurgy of fuel tank and other accessories of vehicles running on ethanol-blended petrol. Another innovation called Bharat Neutrachem is a patented to neutralise amine system to prevent corrosion in refinery columns' overhead circuits. It is deployed in its Kochi Refinery. Then there are CO Promoter or COP-CAT which is a superior additive promoting complete combustion in FCCU regenerator dense catalyst bed and is deployed in Mumbai Refinery. BPCL is the third company in the world after Exxon-Mobil and Chevron to have such a technology, Bhargava said.

"With the acquisition of Bhushan Power & Steel hanging fire and the expansion of Dolvi Works under Covid cloud, JSW Steel's move up the league table of Indian steel producers is now delayed. With an installed capacity of 18 million tonnes, JSW Steel is the third largest steelmaker. Public sector steel major, Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has an installed capacity of 20.3 million tonnes, confirmed company executives while Tata Steel is at 19.6 million tonnes. Tata Steel figures include Tata Steel standalone, Tata Steel BSL and Tata Steel Long Products. JSW Steel's growth - through organic and inorganic routes - would have restored its position as the largest steelmaker in India this year but the plans are delayed for different reasons. The acquisition of BPSL, having a capacity of three million tonnes, is caught in a legal web and will now be heard in Supreme Court. The five-million-tonne expansion at Dolvi, on the other hand - supposed to be completed in June - had to be postponed due to Covid. ALSO READ: Weak demand, oversupply, price drop to hit steel sector in Q2 FY21: Ind-Ra JSW Steel mentioned in its annual report that it had received permission to restart activities towards the end of April 2020. However, the expansion project was hampered as a number of workers employed by contractors began to head home. ""Further, non-availability of foreign experts (from our technology and equipment suppliers) due to international travel restrictions is also impacting the commissioning schedule,"" it was mentioned in the annual report. The expansion of crude steel capacity at Dolvi Works from 5 to 10 million tonnes, along with the captive power plant and coke oven plant is therefore likely to get delayed into the second half of FY2021. Icra senior vice president, Jayanta Roy, said, JSW Steel, which was poised to become the largest steel player in India at this time in terms of installed capacity is currently the third largest, if one considers Tata Steel's total steel capacity including those of its domestic subsidiaries. ""JSW's large expansion project at Dolvi suffered twice - first because of floods in FY2020 and now because of Covid -19, delaying project implementation,"" he added.

"Phoenix Contact, Quectel and Ericsson have worked together to develop and deploy the first industrial 5G router for local industrial applications in a private 5G network. With the help of the newly developed 5G Router, industrial applications, such as machines, controls and other equipment, can now be connected to a private 5G network and thus be orchestrated in their resource usage, priority and behavior. They therefore offer a decisive advantage compared to previous mobile radio solutions, which can only use all - mostly license-free - radio bands with a best effort principle and which have to accept performance losses in equal measure when the radio spectrum is heavily occupied. To achieve this, all three companies brought their strengths together: Phoenix Contact as the first choice supplier of WLAN, Bluetooth and mobile radio routers for industrial applications, Quectel as the leading global supplier of cellular and GNSS modules and Ericsson supporting the product development as a network supplier and a leading force of the 5G technology development. By starting to interact at an early stage, the three companies have been able to rapidly develop a solution that provides industrial-grade performance over private 5G networks. The collaboration between Quectel, Phoenix Contact and Ericsson has seen extensive interoperability testing at the Ericsson lab to ensure the reliable commercial performance of the 5G router. The experience made is highly important for Ericsson following the strategic approach offering 5G solutions jointly with mobile network operators towards the industry. In addition, all three companies cooperated closely to enable Industry 4.0 applications with this 5G standalone private network.

"Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) plans to increase its network of aviation fuel stations by 50 per cent as it looks to capture greater market share in the business currently controlled by public sector oil retailing firms. In its latest annual report, RIL said the double-digit growth observed over 52 consecutive months might have been stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but India continues to be one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world for the fifth consecutive year. RIL, which operates the world's largest single location oil refining complex, plans to capture this opportunity through increased presence at airports to refuel airplanes. Air-passenger traffic in India rose 9 per cent even in February after the Indian carriers recouped to full capacity that was lowered following the closure of a major domestic carrier in the first few months of financial year 2019-20 (April 2019 to March 2020) as well as disruptions at Mumbai airport owing to construction and maintenance, it said. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, while travel restrictions were being imposed elsewhere, India was largely unaffected till the end of March 2020, before the sharp escalation in travel bans globally and lockdowns impacted India's aviation sector too. ""On account of its network strength, cost competitiveness, industry leading technology and best-in-class service standards, RIL improved its volume share in the domestic market,"" according to the annual report. Reliance Aviation has the highest market share in 20 per cent of the operating airports. ""RIL is looking to increase its network to 45 locations as against 30 at the end of FY 2019-20 and is well geared to benefit with the growth in the Indian aviation market,"" it said. India currently has 256 aviation fuel stations, with state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) owning 119 of them. Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) has 61 and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) the remaining 44. RIL is the largest private aviation fuel retailer with 31 stations, according to the latest data from the oil ministry. In comparison, RIL's auto fuel retailing network is very small. Out of 69,392 petrol pumps in the country, RIL operates 1,398. IOC has the highest number of outlets at 29,208, followed by HPCL with 16,557 and BPCL with 16,309 petrol pumps. Russia's Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy is the biggest private auto fuel retailer with 5,720 petrol pumps. RIL said it registered 9.8 per cent growth in retail diesel sales and 14.7 per cent in retail petrol volume as compared with 1.5 per cent and 6.3 per cent for industry, respectively. During financial year 2019-20, RIL registered over 10 per cent growth in average outlet sales volume. On bulk diesel, RIL said it registered a volume growth of 10.8 per cent, increasing market share to 8.8 per cent, despite expected demand contraction and margin pressure. Direct sales volume would be driven by continued volume growth from railways and sourcing higher volume shares in State Transport Units (STUs), it said.

"New Delhi, Jul 4 () After raising billions of dollars from the likes of Facebook and Intel for its digital business, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries has launched JioMeet video conferencing app with unlimited free calling that is being seen as rate war on rival Zoom. The JioMeet video conferencing app is available across Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and web since Thursday evening after beta testing. According to the company website, JioMeet supports HD audio and video call quality with up to 100 participants and offers features like screen sharing, meeting schedule feature and more. Advertisement But unlike Zoom, it does not impose a 40-minute time limit. Calls can go on as long as 24 hours, and all meetings are encrypted and password-protected, the company said.Based on USD 15 per month charge for meetings of more than 40 minutes on Zoom (USD 180 on annual basis), JioMeet is providing the same functionality and more free of cost, translating into Rs 13,500 savings for a host per year, company sources said. According to app features listed on Google Play Store, JioMeet offers easy sign up with either mobile number or e-mail ID and allows creation of instant meeting. Advertisement The meeting in HD audio and video quality can be scheduled in advance and details shared with invitees, it said, adding JioMeet allows unlimited meetings per day with each meeting going uninterrupted for up to 24 hours. Each meeting is password protected and the host can enable 'Waiting Room' to ensure no participant joins without permission. It also allows creation of groups and starting calling/chatting on a single click. Advertisement Other features include 'Safe Driving Mode' while driving, multi-device login support for up to five devices and seamless switching from one device to other while on call. The app, which has already seen more than 5 lakh downloads on the Google Play Store and iOS, comes amid the government imposing a ban on 59 popular Chinese apps including TikTok on grounds that they threatened national security and data privacy. The app was launched a day before Reliance announced fund raising from stake sale in Jio Platforms which has now totalled Rs 1.17 lakh crore from 11 investors, ranging from Facebook to Intel Capital. Company sources said no restriction on time limit on JioMeet means teachers will not be required to cut short their classes as they are forced to do on Zoom. Also, the app allows national and international seminars as well as hosting of cultural and social events. Advertisement Unlike Zoom where users cannot expand a participant's video, JioMeet meetings users can expand any participant's video or shared screen's video by a double tap. Also, JioMeet has two advanced meeting settings over and above Zoom options. First, it allows participants only from the host's organisation. If enabled, only users from the host's organsation can join that meeting, eliminating potential snoops from other IDs. Secondly, it does not allow guest users -- if enabled, every user will be required to sign up before joining the meeting hence restricting anonymous users from joining the call. Advertisement Unlike Zoom, JioMeet users can switch from one device to another without dropping out of the call. Zoom allows sign up only with e-mail ID while JioMeet allows sign up with e-mail and mobile number.Inside the call, Zoom shows four participants at a time on a single mobile screen (for others, users need to scroll through multiple pages). JioMeet allows nine active participants on a single mobile screen. ANZ ABM ABM

"Workers at Tata Steel's main plant in the Netherlands ended a three-week strike on Friday after the company said there would be no compulsory layoffs under a planned reorganisation of its Dutch operations. ""We are pleased to announce we have reached an agreement with all unions involved,"" Tata Steel's Dutch division said in a statement. ""The transformation programme will not lead to forced redundancies at Tata Steel Netherlands."" The company did not say whether there would be a voluntary redundancy programme but said it would now extend its current jobs pact for IJmuiden, which stipulates no forced layoffs, by five years until October 2026. Workers at the IJmuiden plant went on strike on June 10 after unions said the company had outlined plans to scrap around 1,000 of the 9,000 jobs at the site as part of a reorganisation of its European operations. Tata Steel Europe last year announced a major overhaul of its British and Dutch activities, at the cost of around 3,000 jobs in total. Tata Steel Europe has said IJmuiden needs to become more profitable as the steel sector grappled with the effects of overcapacity, cheap Chinese imports and U.S. trade tariffs, even before the global coronavirus recession hit. ""This agreement offers a counterweight against the risks we see coming from Tata Steel Europe,"" Roel Berghuis, spokesman for the FNV union, said on Friday, adding that workers would now return to work on Friday. Under the agreement reached with unions, Tata also promised to invest in innovation and cleaner production technologies and not to quickly divest any part of its Dutch activities or to outsource work done in the Netherlands. Tata is expected to present detailed plans for the future of IJmuiden by the end of September.

"New Delhi, Jul 5 () Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) plans to increase its network of aviation fuel stations by 50 per cent as it looks to capture greater market share in the business currently controlled by public sector oil retailing firms. In its latest annual report, RIL said the double-digit growth observed over 52 consecutive months might have been stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but India continues to be one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world for the fifth consecutive year. RIL, which operates the world's largest single location oil refining complex, plans to capture this opportunity through increased presence at airports to refuel airplanes. Advertisement Air-passenger traffic in India rose 9 per cent even in February after the Indian carriers recouped to full capacity that was lowered following the closure of a major domestic carrier in the first few months of financial year 2019-20 (April 2019 to March 2020) as well as disruptions at Mumbai airport owing to construction and maintenance, it said.Following the COVID-19 pandemic, while travel restrictions were being imposed elsewhere, India was largely unaffected till the end of March 2020, before the sharp escalation in travel bans globally and lockdowns impacted India's aviation sector too. ""On account of its network strength, cost competitiveness, industry leading technology and best-in-class service standards, RIL improved its volume share in the domestic market,"" according to the annual report. Advertisement Reliance Aviation has the highest market share in 20 per cent of the operating airports. ""RIL is looking to increase its network to 45 locations as against 30 at the end of FY 2019-20 and is well geared to benefit with the growth in the Indian aviation market,"" it said. Advertisement India currently has 256 aviation fuel stations, with state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) owning 119 of them. Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) has 61 and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) the remaining 44. RIL is the largest private aviation fuel retailer with 31 stations, according to the latest data from the oil ministry. In comparison, RIL's auto fuel retailing network is very small. Out of 69,392 petrol pumps in the country, RIL operates 1,398. IOC has the highest number of outlets at 29,208, followed by HPCL with 16,557 and BPCL with 16,309 petrol pumps. Russia's Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy is the biggest private auto fuel retailer with 5,720 petrol pumps. Advertisement RIL said it registered 9.8 per cent growth in retail diesel sales and 14.7 per cent in retail petrol volume as compared with 1.5 per cent and 6.3 per cent for industry, respectively. During financial year 2019-20, RIL registered over 10 per cent growth in average outlet sales volume. On bulk diesel, RIL said it registered a volume growth of 10.8 per cent, increasing market share to 8.8 per cent, despite expected demand contraction and margin pressure. Direct sales volume would be driven by continued volume growth from railways and sourcing higher volume shares in State Transport Units (STUs), it said. ANZ RVK

"New Delhi, July 4 After raising billions of dollars from the likes of Facebook and Intel for its digital business, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries has launched JioMeet video-conferencing app with unlimited free calling that is being seen as rate war on rival Zoom. The JioMeet video-conferencing app is available across Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and web since Thursday evening after beta-testing. According to the company website, JioMeet supports HD audio and video call quality with up to 100 participants and offers features like screen sharing, meeting schedule feature and more. But unlike Zoom, it does not impose a 40-minute time limit. Calls can go on as long as 24 hours, and all meetings are encrypted and password-protected, the company said. Based on USD 15 per month charge for meetings of more than 40 minutes on Zoom (USD 180 on annual basis), JioMeet is providing the same functionality and more free of cost, translating into Rs 13,500 savings for a host per year, company sources said. According to app features listed on Google Play Store, JioMeet offers easy sign up with either mobile number or e-mail ID and allows creation of instant meeting. The meeting in HD audio and video quality can be scheduled in advance and details shared with invitees, it said, adding JioMeet allows unlimited meetings per day with each meeting going uninterrupted for up to 24 hours. Each meeting is password protected and the host can enable 'Waiting Room' to ensure no participant joins without permission. It also allows creation of groups and starting calling/chatting on a single click. Other features include 'Safe Driving Mode' while driving, multi-device login support for up to five devices and seamless switching from one device to other while on call. The app, which has already seen more than 5 lakh downloads on the Google Play Store and iOS, comes amid the government imposing a ban on 59 popular Chinese apps, including TikTok, on grounds that they threatened national security and data privacy. The app was launched a day before Reliance announced fund raising from stake sale in Jio Platforms which has now totalled Rs 1.17 lakh crore from 11 investors, ranging from Facebook to Intel Capital. Company sources said no restriction on time limit on JioMeet means teachers will not be required to cut short their classes as they are forced to do on Zoom. Also, the app allows national and international seminars as well as hosting of cultural and social events. Unlike Zoom where users cannot expand a participant's video, JioMeet meetings users can expand any participant's video or shared screen's video by a double tap. Also, JioMeet has two advanced meeting settings over and above Zoom options. First, it allows participants only from the host's organisation. If enabled, only users from the host's organsation can join that meeting, eliminating potential snoops from other IDs. Second, it does not allow guest users -- if enabled, every user will be required to sign up before joining the meeting hence restricting anonymous users from joining the call. Unlike Zoom, JioMeet users can switch from one device to another without dropping out of the call. Zoom allows sign up only with e-mail ID while JioMeet allows sign up with e-mail and mobile number. Inside the call, Zoom shows four participants at a time on a single mobile screen (for others, users need to scroll through multiple pages). JioMeet allows nine active participants on a single mobile screen. PTI

"BHEL, BEML, Titagarh express interest in Mumbai monorail projects, The development comes after the MMRDA last month scrapped the bids by two Chinese firms MUMBAI (Metro Rail News): Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) cancels the bidding process for procuring monorail rakes in which two Chinese companies submit their bids.

"At a time when new vehicle sales are few and far between, auto component players with a sizeable presence in after-market sales are better-placed to tide over the slowdown. Battery and tyre manufactures are among such companies. Investors with a one- to two-year perspective can buy the stock of Exide Industries. Exide is the market leader in the automotive battery segment. Demand for replacement of batteries in existing vehicles is expected to keep volumes afloat for the company until new vehicle sales pick up. This apart, presence in industrial batteries is a positive. The company is also a market leader in almost all the segments it operates in, such as UPS, solar, railways, power and traction applications. Its inroads into sale of batteries for electric vehicles, too, is a shot in the arm. Taking cue from the rally in the broader market, the stock has gained about 25 per cent from the one-year low of ?121.90 it touched in mid-March. The stock currently trades at 15.7 times its trailing 12-month earnings. This is at a discount to peer Amara Raja, which trades at 17.6 times. Replacement demand New vehicle sales, which was already facing multiple challenges since mid-2018, has further been hit due to Covid-19. Overall, volume growth for the auto industry, which stood at 5.15 per cent in 2018-19 (over the previous fiscal), dropped by about 18 per cent in 2019-20. This fiscal, too, has been a near wipe-out so far, with the Covid-19 outbreak forcing production and dealership shutdowns. Companies have restarted production to an extent and reopened most dealerships, but demand still remains a wild card. Vehicles are big-ticket consumption items and predominantly financed purchases. Job losses, pay cuts and income uncertainty are dampeners to purchases at this juncture. Besides, commercial vehicle sales are faced with bigger challenges due to the overall economic slowdown decreasing demand for freight carriage. The permit for existing vehicles to carry higher loads (new axle load norms) have also been a big blow to new truck sales. While companies expect some green shoots only from the second half of this fiscal, CRISIL expects the auto industry to record a 21-28 per cent fall in volumes in 2020-21. A meaningful recovery in new vehicle sales could be possible only in the next fiscal. In such a scenario, battery and tyre manufacturers are better-placed to tide over the slowdown as they have a sizeable presence in after-market sales as these components need to be replaced every 3-4 years in existing vehicles. Over the past few years, Exide has initiated measures to strengthen its market share in the automotive replacement segment. These include increased support to dealers, improvement in after-sales service, faster turnaround in warranty claims, launch of new products and a marketing push of brands such as Dynex, which is targeted at the lower-value segment. Exide has the widest distribution in the industry with a combined direct and indirect network of over 48,000 dealers. Over the long term, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime should benefit Exide on the replacement side as well. Compliance requirements under the GST will bring down the price advantage that unorganised battery-makers enjoy currently. This is expected to increase demand for organised players such as Exide, especially in the commercial vehicles and tractors segments. Currently, the unorganised segment garners a 40 per cent share in the replacement battery market. Exide is well-placed to catch up when new vehicle sales pick up, too. It counts almost all auto manufacturers, such as Hyundai, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Mahindra and Mahindra, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Hero, Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto, TVS, Royal Enfield and Honda two-wheelers, among its clients. It is also the sole supplier to recent and successful launches such as Kia Seltos, MG Hector and Hyundai Venue as well as the upcoming Tata Gravitas. The company has also taken measures to tackle the shift to electric vehicles, which require lithium-ion batteries rather than the lead-acid ones currently in use. It has entered into a joint venture with Switzerland-based Leclanché to build lithium-ion batteries for Indias electric vehicle market. A lithium-ion module and pack assembling plant for various vehicle segments will be set up for the same. The firm has already introduced Exide Neo, a battery-powered e-rickshaw to showcase its lithium-ion capabilities. Financials Tepid demand from the auto manufacturers as well as disruption due to the lockdown saw the company clocking weak numbers in the quarter ended March 2020. Revenues and profits dropped 20 per cent each over the same period last year, to ?2,055 crore and ?168 crore, respectively. Lack of operating leverage weighed on the margins. Operating margins came in at 13.1 per cent, lower than the 14.3 per cent achieved in the March 2019 quarter. However, the price of lead  the key raw material  which hovered around $2,000 a tonne in January, has cooled off to $1,700-1,800 now. Given the global slowdown, raw material prices are not expected to inch up sharply this year. The company is debt-free.

"MUMBAI : As many as three Indian companies have shown interest in manufacturing rakes for the monorail projects, weeks after town planning authority MMRDA scrapped the bids by two Chinese firms. Last month, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) scrapped the Rs500 crore contract for sourcing 10 rakes for the Jacob Circle-Wadala-Chembur monorail project wherein two Chinese firms had expressed their interest to supply the rakes, stating that the companies were ""dictating"" terms. ""Three Indian companies have shown interest in designing and developing Mono rail rolling stock,"" the authority tweeted. MMRDA Commissioner RA Rajeev had earlier said that the authority was in talks with Indian companies including Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) and Bharat Earth Movers (BEML), among others, for the contract. ""BHEL, BEML and a private sector player Titagarh have expressed their interest,"" an MMRDA official said. BEML has already bagged the contract for manufacturing metro rakes for Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E). ""After giving first order for make in India metro coaches for Line 2 and 7,hopefully will get develop mono rail coaches in India,"" the authority said in the tweet. Last year, MMRDA had floated a global tender to design, manufacture and supply 10 rakes and had received bids from China's CRR Corporation (China Rail Road Corporation) and BYD (Build Your Dreams) as well as an American firm. However, the authority later cancelled the tender in January this year, when bidders were seeking changes in the terms. In February, the authority reinvited the bids and the size of the contract was around Rs500 crore. According to MMRDA, the Chinese firms which had again bid for the contract were continuously asking for revisions in terms and conditions and eligibility criteria. MMRDA also noted that due to the current economic situation that has arisen following the COVID-19 pandemic and in line with the various polices announced by the government to encourage 'Make in India' schemes, it has been decided to look for Indian technology partners for development and long term support. In March last year, MMRDA commissioned the operations of the second phase of the 19.54 km monorail project after it took over the operations and maintenance of the project from Scomi Engineering in December 2018. The latter had failed to supply the contracted rakes and other operational materials, including signalling equipment, and maintain the quality of monorail services despite many extensions. MMRDA had also terminated its contract with the LTSE consortium (Larsen & Toubro and Scomi Engineering), which had the contract to build the country's first and only monorail in the megapolis. The L&T-Scomi consortium had won the Rs2,460-crore contract in 2009 to build and operate the 19.5-km monorail network on the Chembur-Wadala-Jacob Circle corridor connecting the eastern periphery of the city to the central parts. The 8.9-km-long first phase of the monorail from Chembur to Wadala was opened to the public in February 2014, almost four years after the original deadline, while the second phase from Jacob Circle to Wadala was opened in March last year.

"Acer has announced its new Swift 5 notebook that offers a new take on productivity, powerful yet light enough to be carried around throughout the day. The ultraportable device is a beacon of both design and performance, sporting a professional aesthetic that is backed up by impressive functionality. This years model features ultra-narrow bezels that allow for a 90% screen-to-body ratio, a touchscreen with Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass and new colours, such as mist green. The new Swift 5 pushes the envelope on what thin-and-light notebooks can be, said James Lin, General Manager, Notebooks, IT Products Business, Acer Inc. A productivity powerhouse housed in a sleek and ultraportable chassis, the Swift 5 is an excellent option for professionals who are always on the move and seeking a device capable of keeping up with them. Less Than 1 kg: Do More With Less The Acer Swift 5 (SF514-55) is an ultrathin-and-light notebook that sits at the intersection of style, power and portability. Its 14.95 mm (0.59 in) chassis is made from high-grade magnesium-lithium and magnesium-aluminium, allowing it to pack the next-gen Intel Core processors with powerful integrated graphics based on Intels new Xe architecture and optional NVIDIA GeForce MX350 GPUs while staying under 1 kg (2.2 lbs). This power makes it possible to seamlessly run multiple applications at once, and 1 TB of high-speed PCle SSD storage on top of up to 16 GB LPDDRAX ensures that they load quickly. Furthermore, those in the office or on a conference call will appreciate the ability to control how much sound the device makes by alternating between three cooling modes: silent, normal or performance. Svelte Aesthetics and a Stunning Screen The Swift 5 has an elegant design that comes in two colour palates: mist green or safari gold, both with gold accents. The notebooks all-metal chassis is defined by confidently sharp angles and a minimalist profile that makes it an excellent option for image-conscious professionals. That being said, the Swift 5s design is not all about looks. This years model includes a specially designed hinge that slightly elevates the device while the screen is opened, allowing for a more ergonomic typing experience, better thermal performance and, most notably, makes the devices beautiful screen more prominent. Opening the notebook reveals a generously large trackpad and a 14-inch FHD IPS4 touchscreen display, both of which support multi-finger gestures to offer an incredibly intuitive experience.

First responders and industrial manufacturing workers will find the Acer Enduro N7 to be a reliable companion, while event producers and outdoor hobbyists will appreciate the thin-and-light yet durable Enduro N3. A series of Enduro tablets are also available for retail, warehouse and manufacturing usage scenarios. With an increasingly modern workforce, more and more mobile devices are being deployed in the field where they are subject to harsher handling. Enduro, our new line of rugged notebooks and tablets, was created to provide our customers with the durability and performance that gets the job done, said Andrew Chuang, General Manager, Rugged Computing, Acer Inc. Acer Enduro N7 Rugged Notebook The Acer Enduro N7 is a rugged notebook constructed with shock-absorbent materials to offer the reliability needed by first responders, field and industrial manufacturing workers while on the job. MIL-810G and IP65 certified, the device has been engineered to withstand drops onto the hardest flooring and to resist the ingress of dust and water. This durability makes the device suitable for work, hot or cold, and its 700-nit, 14-inch FHD screen offers excellent visibility whether inside or outside. For those working long days, the Enduro N7 comes with dual batteries: one hot-swappable battery with a long 10-hour life and another built-in bridge battery. In addition to being able to physically survive chaotic work environments, the Enduro N7 is equipped with the technology necessary to thrive in a modern workplace. A quad-core 8th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU offers enough power to smoothly navigate between several different applications and work on multiple tasks at the same time.

Acer Enduro T1 Rugged Tablets The Acer Enduro T1 (ET110-31W) is a flexible and rugged 10-inch Windows tablet that can double as a 10.1-inch notebook via an optional portfolio keyboard. The devices MIL-STD 810G and IP54 certifications, combined with an Intel Celeron processor and 64 GB of eMMC storage space, make it a reliable and convenient option for quick work on the go. The Enduro T1 can also be used while wearing gloves. The Acer Enduro T1 (ET108-11A) is a compact and durable 8-inch Android tablet designed especially for smart retail, warehouse and factory workers.

"At Acers online global press conference, the company announced significant new updates to four of its popular gaming notebooks: the Predator Helios 700, Predator Helios 300, Predator Triton 300 and Nitro 7. These new refreshed models bring exciting updates across the board, giving gamers of all levels and types something to look forward to. The notebook lines now include the latest 10th Gen Intel Core processors for desktop-calibre gaming that can be taken anywhere. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER or RTX 2070 SUPER graphics deliver the performance needed to drive fast displays with high refresh rates for blur-free seamless visuals even in the most demanding of AAA games. To keep the notebooks operating at peak performance and optimal temperature, Acer has equipped the notebooks with enhanced thermal designs, new cooling technologies and additional heat pipes. Predator Helios 700  A Notebook That Can Replace Your Desktop The Predator Helios 700, featuring the iconic sliding HyperDrift keyboard, has been upgraded to include either an overclockable 10th Gen Intel Core i9-10980HK or i7-10875H processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER or RTX 2070 SUPER graphics. The devices thermal management capabilities have been significantly enhanced with a new thermal solution called Predator PowerGem, included on models with the Intel Core i9 processor. PowerGem is a special material with 3.83 times more vertical heat conductivity than copper, improving the notebooks heat emission efficiency. All models include three copper heat pipes, Acer CoolBoost Technology, a vapour chamber and two Acer custom-engineered 4th Gen AeroBlade 3D fans. Additional high-performance updates include faster 2933 Hz memory (max 64 GB), an additional Thunderbolt 3 port (for a total of two) and the latest Killer DoubleShot Pro (Wi-Fi 6 AX1650i wireless and E3100G Ethernet) to ensure that speed-critical applications get bandwidth priority. Fast PCIe NVMe Solid State Drives in RAID 0 keep everything lightning fast, and games will roar to life on the Helios 700s beautiful 17.3-inch 144 Hz FHD IPS1 display and NVIDIA G-SYNC technology. The keyboard, which features per-key RGB lighting and anti-ghosting, has been updated to include MagTek mechanical switches for the WASD keys and a set of new racing keys which offer increased precision. Designed for racing games, they feature a 1.5 mm of keycap curvature that enables gamers to make finer and more controlled movements in-game. Gamers can swap the standard WASD keys on the keyboard out with the included MagForce keys and racing keys, choosing the set best suited for the game theyre playing. Once swapped, gamers can use the Predator Sense app or press the P3 hotkey in order to adjust the keys lighting and actuation point. Predator Helios 300  Powerful, Feature Packed Acers popular Predator Helios 300 has raised the bar for gaming notebooks, offering the best performance for the dollar. Now available with the latest 10th Gen Intel Core H-series processors, overclockable NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 with Max-Q Design graphics and a 240 Hz 15.6-inch FHD IPS display with 3 ms overdrive, the newest Helios 300 has cemented its reputation as one of the most powerful and feature-packed yet affordably-priced gaming notebooks available. It also supports up to 32 GB of 2933 MHz DDR4 memory, two PCIe NVMe SSDs in RAID 0 configuration and up to a 2 TB hard drive, delivering the speed and storage necessary to maintain large libraries of AAA games and movies. Enhancing the overall performance and gaming experience, DTS:X Ultra Audio delivers high-end 360-degree surround sound for experiencing media in a realistic spatial soundscape. With headphones, it provides an authentic audio experience letting sounds be heard as they were meant to be, whether near or far, and has specifically tuned sound modes that are optimized for different game genres (strategy, RPG or FPS). Acers custom-engineered cooling technology ensures that the device runs at an optimal temperature. The notebook features dual fans, including one newly-designed 4th Generation AeroBlade 3D fan that reduces noise while increasing airflow, and Acer CoolBoost, which allows manual adjustment of the fans to ensure that critical areas receive continuous cooling. Strategically placed intake and exhaust vents are also included. Predator Triton 300  Slim, Lightweight and Powerful, Ideal for Gamers and Content Creators Acers powerful but slim Predator Triton 300 gaming notebook has been refreshed to include a 10th Gen Intel Core H-series processor, up to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 with Max-Q Design graphics and a 240 Hz display refresh rate. The 15.6-inch FHD IPS display also features a 3 ms response time, 300 nit brightness and 100% sRGB spec, making it ideal for both gaming and content creation. It further supports up to three M.2 SSDs (one PCIe, two combos), providing an abundance of storage and the lightning-fast transfer rates and speed that gamers crave. Three heat pipes have been added to the devices advanced thermal design, which also includes a dual-fan cooling system (one 4th Gen AeroBlade 3D metal fan), CoolBoost technology and strategically placed intake and exhaust vents. All this performance is housed in a thin and lightweight metal chassis that measures just 19.9 mm (0.78 inches) thin and 2.1 kg (4.63 lbs), making it easy to game on the go. Nitro 7  Sleek Metal Design for Gaming on the Go Acers updated Nitro 7 is another option for gamers seeking portability. Its sleek metal chassis measures just 19.9 mm (0.78 inches) thin and 2.5 kg (5.51 lbs), but still manages to pack in a 10th Gen Intel Core H-series processor and up to a GeForce RTX 2060 GPU. With up to three slots for high-speed M.2 SSDs, up to 1 TB in RAID 0 configuration, up to 32 GB of DDR4 2933 memory, Killer Ethernet E2600 and Intel Wi-Fi 6, game load and response times are incredibly quick. The Nitro 7s thermal design includes dual fans, a quad exhaust port design and Acer CoolBoost technology, adjustable in NitroSense to increase fan speed by 10% and CPU/GPU cooling by 9% compared to auto-mode. On top of the performance this makes possible, a 15.6-inch non-glare FHD IPS display with a 144 Hz refresh rate and 3 ms response allows for sharp visuals and smooth, blur-free gameplay.

"Acer has announced its new Swift 5 notebook that offers a new take on productivity, powerful yet light enough to be carried around throughout the day. The ultraportable device is a beacon of both design and performance, sporting a professional aesthetic that is backed up by impressive functionality. This years model features ultra-narrow bezels that allow for a 90% screen-to-body ratio, a touchscreen with Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass and new colours, such as mist green. The new Swift 5 pushes the envelope on what thin-and-light notebooks can be, said James Lin, General Manager, Notebooks, IT Products Business, Acer Inc. A productivity powerhouse housed in a sleek and ultraportable chassis, the Swift 5 is an excellent option for professionals who are always on the move and seeking a device capable of keeping up with them. Less Than 1 kg: Do More With Less The Acer Swift 5 (SF514-55) is an ultrathin-and-light notebook that sits at the intersection of style, power and portability. Its 14.95 mm (0.59 in) chassis is made from high-grade magnesium-lithium and magnesium-aluminium, allowing it to pack the next-gen Intel Core processors with powerful integrated graphics based on Intels new Xe architecture and optional NVIDIA GeForce MX350 GPUs while staying under 1 kg (2.2 lbs). This power makes it possible to seamlessly run multiple applications at once, and 1 TB of high-speed PCle SSD storage on top of up to 16 GB LPDDRAX ensures that they load quickly. Furthermore, those in the office or on a conference call will appreciate the ability to control how much sound the device makes by alternating between three cooling modes: silent, normal or performance. Svelte Aesthetics and a Stunning Screen The Swift 5 has an elegant design that comes in two colour palates: mist green or safari gold, both with gold accents. The notebooks all-metal chassis is defined by confidently sharp angles and a minimalist profile that makes it an excellent option for image-conscious professionals. That being said, the Swift 5s design is not all about looks. This years model includes a specially designed hinge that slightly elevates the device while the screen is opened, allowing for a more ergonomic typing experience, better thermal performance and, most notably, makes the devices beautiful screen more prominent. Opening the notebook reveals a generously large trackpad and a 14-inch FHD IPS4 touchscreen display, both of which support multi-finger gestures to offer an incredibly intuitive experience. The screen features 300 nits brightness, covers 72% of the NTSC gamut and is surrounded by ultra-narrow bezels on all four sides that allow for up to a 90% screen-to-body ratio, creating a vivid and immersive viewing experience that makes the Swift 5 perfect for enjoying movies and relaxing after work. Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass The Swift 5s touchscreen display is covered with a layer of Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass, which has been specially formulated to reduce the growth of odour and stain-causing microorganisms on the touch display. Additionally, users have the option to further include an antimicrobial solution on the touchpad, keyboard and all covers of the device. Full Connectivity and All-Day Battery Life The Swift 5 features a large 56 Wh battery that lasts all day and can be fast-charged in a pinch, granting 4 hours of use off just a 30-minute charge-time. A host of connectivity options such as USB Type-C, Thunderbolt and USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, in addition to dual-band Intel Wi-Fi 6 (GIG+) and Bluetooth 5.0, make it an excellent choice for professionals and users who need to work on the go. For convenience and security, the Swift 5 is also equipped with an embedded fingerprint reader for Windows Hello. It also supports Wake on Voice, enabling users to activate and query Windows 10 even when the screen is off. Pricing and Availability The Acer Swift 5 will be available in North America in October starting at USD 999.99; in EMEA in October starting at EUR 1,099; and in China in October, starting at RMB 6,999. Exact specifications, prices, and availability will vary by region.

First responders and industrial manufacturing workers will find the Acer Enduro N7 to be a reliable companion, while event producers and outdoor hobbyists will appreciate the thin-and-light yet durable Enduro N3. A series of Enduro tablets are also available for retail, warehouse and manufacturing usage scenarios. With an increasingly modern workforce, more and more mobile devices are being deployed in the field where they are subject to harsher handling. Enduro, our new line of rugged notebooks and tablets, was created to provide our customers with the durability and performance that gets the job done, said Andrew Chuang, General Manager, Rugged Computing, Acer Inc. Acer Enduro N7 Rugged Notebook The Acer Enduro N7 is a rugged notebook constructed with shock-absorbent materials to offer the reliability needed by first responders, field and industrial manufacturing workers while on the job. MIL-810G and IP65 certified, the device has been engineered to withstand drops onto the hardest flooring and to resist the ingress of dust and water. This durability makes the device suitable for work, hot or cold, and its 700-nit, 14-inch FHD screen offers excellent visibility whether inside or outside. For those working long days, the Enduro N7 comes with dual batteries: one hot-swappable battery with a long 10-hour life and another built-in bridge battery. In addition to being able to physically survive chaotic work environments, the Enduro N7 is equipped with the technology necessary to thrive in a modern workplace.

Acer Enduro T1 Rugged Tablets The Acer Enduro T1 (ET110-31W) is a flexible and rugged 10-inch Windows tablet that can double as a 10.1-inch notebook via an optional portfolio keyboard. The devices MIL-STD 810G and IP54 certifications, combined with an Intel Celeron processor and 64 GB of eMMC storage space, make it a reliable and convenient option for quick work on the go. The Enduro T1 can also be used while wearing gloves. The Acer Enduro T1 (ET108-11A) is a compact and durable 8-inch Android tablet designed especially for smart retail, warehouse and factory workers.

"At Acers online global press conference, the company announced significant new updates to four of its popular gaming notebooks: the Predator Helios 700, Predator Helios 300, Predator Triton 300 and Nitro 7. These new refreshed models bring exciting updates across the board, giving gamers of all levels and types something to look forward to. The notebook lines now include the latest 10th Gen Intel Core processors for desktop-calibre gaming that can be taken anywhere. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER or RTX 2070 SUPER graphics deliver the performance needed to drive fast displays with high refresh rates for blur-free seamless visuals even in the most demanding of AAA games. To keep the notebooks operating at peak performance and optimal temperature, Acer has equipped the notebooks with enhanced thermal designs, new cooling technologies and additional heat pipes. Predator Helios 700  A Notebook That Can Replace Your Desktop The Predator Helios 700, featuring the iconic sliding HyperDrift keyboard, has been upgraded to include either an overclockable 10th Gen Intel Core i9-10980HK or i7-10875H processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER or RTX 2070 SUPER graphics. The devices thermal management capabilities have been significantly enhanced with a new thermal solution called Predator PowerGem, included on models with the Intel Core i9 processor. PowerGem is a special material with 3.83 times more vertical heat conductivity than copper, improving the notebooks heat emission efficiency. All models include three copper heat pipes, Acer CoolBoost Technology, a vapour chamber and two Acer custom-engineered 4th Gen AeroBlade 3D fans. Additional high-performance updates include faster 2933 Hz memory (max 64 GB), an additional Thunderbolt 3 port (for a total of two) and the latest Killer DoubleShot Pro (Wi-Fi 6 AX1650i wireless and E3100G Ethernet) to ensure that speed-critical applications get bandwidth priority. Fast PCIe NVMe Solid State Drives in RAID 0 keep everything lightning fast, and games will roar to life on the Helios 700s beautiful 17.3-inch 144 Hz FHD IPS1 display and NVIDIA G-SYNC technology. The keyboard, which features per-key RGB lighting and anti-ghosting, has been updated to include MagTek mechanical switches for the WASD keys and a set of new racing keys which offer increased precision. Designed for racing games, they feature a 1.5 mm of keycap curvature that enables gamers to make finer and more controlled movements in-game. Gamers can swap the standard WASD keys on the keyboard out with the included MagForce keys and racing keys, choosing the set best suited for the game theyre playing. Once swapped, gamers can use the Predator Sense app or press the P3 hotkey in order to adjust the keys lighting and actuation point. Predator Helios 300  Powerful, Feature Packed Acers popular Predator Helios 300 has raised the bar for gaming notebooks, offering the best performance for the dollar. Now available with the latest 10th Gen Intel Core H-series processors, overclockable NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 with Max-Q Design graphics and a 240 Hz 15.6-inch FHD IPS display with 3 ms overdrive, the newest Helios 300 has cemented its reputation as one of the most powerful and feature-packed yet affordably-priced gaming notebooks available. It also supports up to 32 GB of 2933 MHz DDR4 memory, two PCIe NVMe SSDs in RAID 0 configuration and up to a 2 TB hard drive, delivering the speed and storage necessary to maintain large libraries of AAA games and movies. Enhancing the overall performance and gaming experience, DTS:X Ultra Audio delivers high-end 360-degree surround sound for experiencing media in a realistic spatial soundscape. With headphones, it provides an authentic audio experience letting sounds be heard as they were meant to be, whether near or far, and has specifically tuned sound modes that are optimized for different game genres (strategy, RPG or FPS). Acers custom-engineered cooling technology ensures that the device runs at an optimal temperature. The notebook features dual fans, including one newly-designed 4th Generation AeroBlade 3D fan that reduces noise while increasing airflow, and Acer CoolBoost, which allows manual adjustment of the fans to ensure that critical areas receive continuous cooling. Strategically placed intake and exhaust vents are also included. Predator Triton 300  Slim, Lightweight and Powerful, Ideal for Gamers and Content Creators Acers powerful but slim Predator Triton 300 gaming notebook has been refreshed to include a 10th Gen Intel Core H-series processor, up to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 with Max-Q Design graphics and a 240 Hz display refresh rate. The 15.6-inch FHD IPS display also features a 3 ms response time, 300 nit brightness and 100% sRGB spec, making it ideal for both gaming and content creation. It further supports up to three M.2 SSDs (one PCIe, two combos), providing an abundance of storage and the lightning-fast transfer rates and speed that gamers crave. Three heat pipes have been added to the devices advanced thermal design, which also includes a dual-fan cooling system (one 4th Gen AeroBlade 3D metal fan), CoolBoost technology and strategically placed intake and exhaust vents. All this performance is housed in a thin and lightweight metal chassis that measures just 19.9 mm (0.78 inches) thin and 2.1 kg (4.63 lbs), making it easy to game on the go. Nitro 7  Sleek Metal Design for Gaming on the Go Acers updated Nitro 7 is another option for gamers seeking portability. Its sleek metal chassis measures just 19.9 mm (0.78 inches) thin and 2.5 kg (5.51 lbs), but still manages to pack in a 10th Gen Intel Core H-series processor and up to a GeForce RTX 2060 GPU. With up to three slots for high-speed M.2 SSDs, up to 1 TB in RAID 0 configuration, up to 32 GB of DDR4 2933 memory, Killer Ethernet E2600 and Intel Wi-Fi 6, game load and response times are incredibly quick. The Nitro 7s thermal design includes dual fans, a quad exhaust port design and Acer CoolBoost technology, adjustable in NitroSense to increase fan speed by 10% and CPU/GPU cooling by 9% compared to auto-mode. On top of the performance this makes possible, a 15.6-inch non-glare FHD IPS display with a 144 Hz refresh rate and 3 ms response allows for sharp visuals and smooth, blur-free gameplay.

"The Central government, under National Smart Cities Mission, included Aizawl within its ambit on June 25, 2017. The aim was to develop the citys water supply, health, education, sewage systems and facilities including street lighting, traffic, transportation, motor parking facilities etc. and thereby transforming the city to be Smart City. An amount of Rs. 2,053.01 crore was also sanctioned for the project implementation.

"The JioMeet video conferencing app is available across Android, iOS.Windows, macOS and web since Thursday evening. New Delhi: After raising billions of dollars from the likes of Facebook and Intel for its digital business, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries has launched JioMeet video conferencing app with unlimited free calling that is being seen as rate war on rival Zoom. The JioMeet video conferencing app is available across Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and web since Thursday evening after beta testing. According to the company website, JioMeet supports HD audio and video call quality with up to 100 participants and offers features like screen sharing, meeting schedule feature and more. But unlike Zoom, it does not impose a 40-minute time limit. Calls can go on as long as 24 hours, and all meetings are encrypted and password-protected, the company said. Based on USD 15 per month charge for meetings of more than 40 minutes on Zoom (USD 180 on annual basis), JioMeet is providing the same functionality and more free of cost, translating into Rs 13,500 savings for a host per year, company sources said. According to app features listed on Google Play Store, JioMeet offers easy sign up with either mobile number or e-mail ID and allows creation of instant meeting. The meeting in HD audio and video quality can be scheduled in advance and details shared with invitees, it said, adding JioMeet allows unlimited meetings per day with each meeting going uninterrupted for up to 24 hours. Each meeting is password protected and the host can enable 'Waiting Room' to ensure no participant joins without permission. It also allows creation of groups and starting calling/chatting on a single click. Other features include 'Safe Driving Mode' while driving, multi-device login support for up to five devices and seamless switching from one device to other while on call. The app, which has already seen more than 5 lakh downloads on the Google Play Store and iOS, comes amid the government imposing a ban on 59 popular Chinese apps including TikTok on grounds that they threatened national security and data privacy. The app was launched a day before Reliance announced fund raising from stake sale in Jio Platforms which has now totalled Rs 1.17 lakh crore from 11 investors, ranging from Facebook to Intel Capital. Company sources said no restriction on time limit on JioMeet means teachers will not be required to cut short their classes as they are forced to do on Zoom. Also, the app allows national and international seminars as well as hosting of cultural and social events. Unlike Zoom where users cannot expand a participant's video, JioMeet meetings users can expand any participant's video or shared screen's video by a double tap. Also, JioMeet has two advanced meeting settings over and above Zoom options. First, it allows participants only from the host's organisation. If enabled, only users from the host's organsation can join that meeting, eliminating potential snoops from other IDs. Secondly, it does not allow guest users -- if enabled, every user will be required to sign up before joining the meeting hence restricting anonymous users from joining the call. Unlike Zoom, JioMeet users can switch from one device to another without dropping out of the call. Zoom allows sign up only with e-mail ID while JioMeet allows sign up with e-mail and mobile number. Inside the call, Zoom shows four participants at a time on a single mobile screen (for others, users need to scroll through multiple pages). JioMeet allows nine active participants on a single mobile screen.

"Ambanis Reliance Industries Ltd. has launched the JioMeet video conferencing app after beta testing. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) Zoom, one of the few success stories of the Covid-19 pandemic, now faces a new competitor in an app backed by Asias wealthiest person Mukesh Ambani. Ambanis Reliance Industries Ltd., which has scored billions of dollars of investments from Facebook Inc. to Intel Corp. for its digital businesses, has launched the JioMeet video conferencing app after beta testing. The app has already garnered more than 100,000 downloads on the Google Play Store after becoming available Thursday evening. Like Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and other services, JioMeet offers unlimited high-definition calls  but unlike Zoom, it doesnt impose a 40-minute time limit. Calls can go on as long as 24 hours, and all meetings are encrypted and password-protected, the company said on the JioMeet website. The launch coincided with a nationwide ban on dozens of popular apps from Chinese technology giants including ByteDance Ltd.s TikTok and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.s UC Web, on grounds they threatened security and data privacy. JioMeet went viral Friday on social media alongside the hashtag #MadeinIndia.

"After raising billions of dollars from the likes of Facebook and Intel for its digital business, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries has launched JioMeet video conferencing app with unlimited free calling that is being seen as a rival to Zoom. The JioMeet video conferencing app has been available across Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and web since Thursday evening after beta testing. Photo: YS Design According to the company website, JioMeet supports HD audio and video call quality with up to 100 participants, and offers features like screen sharing, meeting schedule feature, and more. But unlike Zoom, it does not impose a 40-minute time limit. Calls can go on for as long as 24 hours, and all meetings are encrypted and password-protected, the company said. While Zoom charges $15 per month charge for meetings of more than 40 minutes ($180 on annual basis), JioMeet is providing the same functionality and more free of cost, translating into Rs 13,500 savings for a host per year, company sources said. According to app features listed on Google Play Store, JioMeet offers easy sign up with either mobile number or e-mail ID and allows creation of instant meeting. The meeting in HD audio and video quality can be scheduled in advance and details are shared with invitees, it said, adding JioMeet allows unlimited meetings per day with each meeting going uninterrupted for up to 24 hours. Each meeting is password protected and the host can enable 'Waiting Room' to ensure no participant joins without permission. It also allows creation of groups and starting calls/chats on a single click. Other features include 'Safe Driving Mode' while driving, multi-device login support for up to five devices, and seamless switching from one device to other while on call. The app, which has already seen more than five lakh downloads on the Google Play Store and iOS, comes amid the government imposing a ban on 59 popular Chinese apps, including TikTok, on grounds that they threatened national security and data privacy. The app was launched a day before Reliance announced fund raising from stake sale in Jio Platforms which has now totalled Rs 1.17 lakh crore from 11 investors, which include Facebook and Intel Capital. Company sources said no restriction on time limit on JioMeet means teachers will not be required to cut short their classes as they are forced to do on Zoom. Also, the app allows national and international seminars as well as hosting of cultural and social events. Unlike Zoom where users cannot expand a participant's video, JioMeet meetings users can expand any participant's video or shared screen video through a double tap. Also, JioMeet has two advanced meeting settings over and above Zoom options. First, it allows participants only from the host's organisation. If enabled, only users from the host's organsation can join that meeting, eliminating potential snoops from other IDs. Secondly, it does not allow guest users  if enabled, every user will be required to sign up before joining the meeting, hence restricting anonymous users from joining the call. Unlike Zoom, JioMeet users can switch from one device to another without dropping out of the call. Zoom allows sign up only with e-mail ID while JioMeet allows sign up with e-mail and mobile number. Inside the call, Zoom shows four participants at a time on a single mobile screen (for others, users need to scroll through multiple pages). JioMeet allows nine active participants on a single mobile screen.

"Amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak and crisis, global rating agency - Moody has rated Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and Reliance Industries (RIL) above the sovereign. They have also cited them as strong financials and significant global earnings. Taking a look into the stats, TCS and Infosys, have been rated two notches above India's Baa3 rating due to their global operations and minimal reliance on domestic funding. While, Reliance Industries has been rated one notch above India's sovereign rating due to diversified business and balanced funding. As per Business Today report, earlier last month, Moody's Investors Service had downgraded India's sovereign rating by one notch to Baa3 from Baa2. They cited that there will be challenges in implementation of policies of a sustained period of low growth, deteriorating fiscal position and stress in the financial sector. Meanwhile, the global rating agency had lowered TCS rating to Baa1 negative from A3 negative in wake of downgrade of India's sovereign rating. While, Infosys' rating to Baa1 negative from A3 negative, which is unlikely to be upgraded unless India's rating is upgraded. Looking at the stats of the last 11 weeks, RIL has raised a total of Rs 1,17,588.45 crore by selling minority stakes in Jio Platforms to Facebook as well as private equity firms such as General Atlantic, Vista Equity, Silver Lake, and KKR.

"Im catching up more on Siemens RealizeLIVE and today I want to talk about flexibility and customization. I learned about Teamcenter X, integration infrastructure, low-code, and Mendix earlier today and I want to share some of my thoughts and also some questions with hope to find the answers. Flexibility is one of the key characteristics of PLM technologies and products. The ability to create a custom data model, add attributes, configure business rules, workflows or customize some behavior  this is a shortlist of demands from engineers and manufacturing companies. Without such features and capabilities, many PLM implementations will be dead on arrival. Out of the box systems always played the role of excellent marketing, but when the rubber was hitting the road, flexibility was the key. Siemens announced that it has acquired Mendix, the popular low-code application development platform, for 0.6 billion (or about $700 million) about two years ago and since then Mendix plays a key role in Siemens strategy of developing custom application and customization. My attention was caught by the following slide explaining the strategy of Teamcenter integration. Check this out. As you can see Teamcenter PLM applications are buried under the layers of other applications and connectors  ActiveWorkspace, TC Connector for Mendix and Mendix platform. The question I have is what level of customization is available in Teamcenter and how it will co-exist with Mendix application development. A separate question is about Teamcenter X and its customization capabilities. From my earlier article of comparison between Teamcenter and Teamcenter X, I learned that Teamcenter doesnt have cloud services. I guess this is a reason for the Mendix connector. However, Teamcenter X has cloud services. Does it mean that it will be connected directly to Mendix? Or maybe Teamcenter X cloud services is Mendix platform? How basic Teamcenter functions will be customized in both Teamcenter and Teamcenter X? What is included in cloud services? How it is different from REST API, which is the de-facto standard in web customization and development. Another slide with the example of big integration gives even more ideas and triggered more questions about how Teamcenter will be integrated and customized. What is my conclusion? Flexibility and customization are a matter of life and death for PLM implementation. While connectors are almost a standard way for integration business, the devil is in the details. How easy to create an integration using all these layers? Will REST API be available for customizing Teamcenter X and what will be the scope of supported functions? Without knowing the answers it is hard to make an assessment of how Teamcenter X will survive the modern SaaS eco-system for openness and integration. Just my thoughts Best, Oleg Disclaimer: Im co-founder and CEO of OpenBOM developing cloud based bill of materials and inventory management tool for manufacturing companies, hardware startups, and supply chain.

"JSW Steel achieved crude steel production of 2.96 million tons in Q1 FY 2020-21. The average capacity utilisation dropped to 76% in June 2020, primarily due to a fall in production at Vijayanagar Works. At Vijayanagar Works, certain employees tested Covid-19 positive (started with an employee who had travelled far away from plant premises on personal work and got infected). This has led to not only hospitalisation of these employees, and an active contact tracing and quarantining of their primary and secondary contacts, but also imposition of restrictions by the local administration on the entry and exit of employees at the plant location. The Company responded promptly and responsibly to control the spread of Covid-19 infection among our workforce and local communities by implementing and intensifying comprehensive prevention and mitigation measures, by leveraging on our existing medical infrastructure and community outreach programme. The Company identified the workforce (including those who resided outside township premises) critical for operation of the plant and made arrangements to accommodate all of them within the townships premises, thus, completely restricting the movement of personnel into and out of factory premises. The Company has been scrupulously following the guidelines, protocols and instructions issued by the local administration from time to time. It is also heartening to see that a majority of such infected employees have also recovered since. The operations are now stabilising with reduced employee strength. The Company has been declared as the ""Preferred Bidder"" for four iron ore mines in the State of Odisha, in the Auctions held by the State Government in February 2020. The Govt. of Odisha has issued vesting orders in respect of these mining blocks viz:-Nuagaon, Narayanposhi, Jajang and Ganua by virtue of which all valid rights, approvals, clearances, licenses and the like vested with the previous Lessee(s) have been deemed to have been acquired by the Company. The Company has signed the Mine Development and Production agreement(s) for all the four blocks and executed the lease deed(s)with Govt. of Odisha after complying with all regulatory aspects. The Company has also started mining operations at all the above said blocks from 1st July 2020. These mines in aggregate have over one billion tonnes of reserves and were operating prior to their closure in March 2020 with environmental clearance to produce upto 29.3 million tonnes annually. The earlier Lessee(s) produced an average of 21.65 million tonnes of iron ore from these mines in the last two years. The Company expects to meet a majority of its requirements of iron ore from these mines, reducing its dependency in sourcing the ore from merchant miners in the State of Odisha.

"The modular SBX advanced steering valve maximizes design flexibility for OEMs June 30, 2020 EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.  Power management company Eaton today announced the production launch of its SBX advanced steering valve, a fail-operational steer-by-wire valve for off-highway machinery. The compact, modular SBX valve increases machine flexibility and intelligence by enabling machine designers to tailor steering performance to the operators preferences and operating conditions. The SBX advanced steering valve was designed for use in a fully electronically controlled steer-by-wire system. Fail-operational functionality is achieved by mounting the SBX valve to a secondary electrohydraulic valve or manifold. Because theres no hydraulic connection to the cab, the valve can be remotely mounted, allowing for more flexible machine design and reduced cab noise. The valve can be paired with the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) machine control system or with an Eaton controller, further increasing design flexibility. With our SBX advanced steering valve, were enabling OEMs to design and differentiate their vehicles in bold new ways, said Kenny Befus, global product manager, Steering Systems, Eaton. The valves modular design and fail-operational capability empower engineers to create unique cab environments while enhancing machine productivity and safety. The SBX advanced steering valve is SIL 2 and PLd capable, which enables OEMs to develop machinery that complies with international standards. Designed for equipment in the construction, agriculture, material handling and forestry industries, the valve is ideal for use with systems incorporating multiple steering wheels or alternative devices, such as a joystick or lever.

"A special winter-grade diesel Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has launched, just for the Ladakh region, will prove to be a lifeline for the Indian armed forces, keeping in view the prospect that the coming winter will be very tense for them because of the India-China conflict. This fuel can withstand extremely low temperatures of around minus 33 degree Celsius. With army movements increasing, the demand for this fuel is expected to increase multifold over 350 tonnes last winter, said a company source. Upping the ante against Chinese aggression, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise visit to the forward position of Nimu in Ladakh on Friday, with Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and Army Chief M M Naravane. In a violent clash between soldiers of the two countries at Galwan on June 15, at least 20 Army persons on the Indian side died. The IndianOil executive said looking at the current situation, the company had stoked up enough winter-grade fuel for the region. Last year, the demand from the armed forces was less than this, he added. ALSO READ: Ladakh standoff: Enemies saw fire and fury of our soldiers, says PM Modi On November 19 last year, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had launched the special fuel for Ladakh soon after the region separated from Jammu and Kashmir on October 31 and became a Union Territory. The launch of this fuel was part of the Rs 50,000 crore investment initiated in the region by the home minister then. What is winter-grade diesel? The fuel was specially designed for motorists in high-altitude sectors like Ladakh, Kargil, Kaza, and Keylong. In these regions, motorists face the problem of freezing diesel during the winter season. Normally, a major component of diesel is paraffin wax, which improves viscosity and lubrication in the fuel. However, with temperature, it melts or thickens, affecting the normal performance of vehicles. IOC had launched this special fuel to address the problem, including additives to diesel, helping it to remain in a fluid situation. This fuel has a low pour-point of minus 33 degree Celsius, which allows it to retain its fluidity even in extremely cold weather. To ensure cooking gas supply to the region, IOC runs an LPG-bottling plant in Phey Village of Ladakh, which is 11,800 feet above the sea level. The plant ensures cooking gas supply to far-flung areas of Ladakh and Kargil, besides serving the Indian security forces. With a capacity of 8,000 tonnes (tmt) per month, it came to limelight as women comprise more than half the staff strength of 20, braving the temperature of minus 30 degree Celsius.

"Vigor Chooses ABB Battery Electric Power For New Ferries In Washington July 2nd, 2020 by Steve Hanley The State of Washington operates the one of the largest ferry fleets in world. Visitors to the Seattle area are well familiar with the sight of its green and white ferries crisscrossing Puget Sound all day every day, almost all of them powered by diesel engines. Combined, they suck down about 20 million gallons of diesel fuel a year, which means they are spewing enormous amounts of carbon dioxide and particulate matter in their wake. Under the leadership of Washington Governor Jay Inslee  one of the few political leaders in the US who takes climate change seriously  the management of the state ferry system has made a serious commitment to reducing pollution from its ferries by converting some existing vessels to electric power and calling for any new ferries to be primarily battery electric vessels. Ian Sterling, a public information officer for Washington State Ferries, told Greentech Media at the end of last year, The government-owned ferry operators annual fuel consumption is on par with that of a midsize airline, making it the states biggest diesel polluter. He added the switch to batteries is not just because the governor said [to do] it. Even if youre not an environmentalist, this is a good idea for the taxpayer because we expect it to pay for itself relatively quickly, based on the price of fuel. It saves millions of dollars annually. The ferry operator has begun converting three of its Jumbo Mark II ferries to electricity. Those three vessels alone consume 5 million gallons of fuel a year. Each of them will have two of its four diesel generators and locomotive engines replaced with battery systems supplied by Siemens. Now Vigor Shipyards, which builds vessels in the Pacific Northwest, has been awarded a contract to build new battery-powered Olympic class ferries for the state of Washington. The first of the new vessels is scheduled to enter service in 2024. Each will have a capacity of 144 cars and 1,500 passengers. This landmark project supports Washington States goal for 2050 to reduce emissions by 57.5 per cent below the emissions level in 2019, utilising a hybrid and electric propulsion solution that is space-efficient, easy to install and flexible in operation, Jay Hebert, vice president of marine fabrication at Vigor, tells Cruise and Ferry magazine. Vigor is delighted to partner with ABB in this remarkable work prompted by the commitment of Washington Governor Jay Inslee, the state legislature and Washington State Ferries to replace aging ferries with clean technology in alignment with the states commitment to environmental stewardship, he added. By 2040, the ferry service expects to replace 13 of its current ships with vessels that operate primarily on electricity (they will have diesel engines as a backup power source) and convert 6 more ferries to become plug-in hybrid vessels, saving more than 10 million gallons of diesel fuel from being burned each year. The electrification project will require the installation of high power chargers at the ferry terminals where the electric ships will dock. Moving towards a zero emission future relies on technologies that meet the environmental and cost needs of today and offer flexibility to integrate future energy sources in the years ahead, says Juha Koskela, managing director of ABB Marine & Ports. ABB is delighted to support this milestone project demonstrating the way that electric, digital and connected solutions can deliver shippings zero-emission future. Seattle joins several other ferry services in Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and elsewhere that are transitioning from diesel ferries to electric or hybrid electric ferries in order to lower costs and reduce emissions from the vessels they operate. Saving the planet is nice, but doing it in a way that saves companies and taxpayers money is even better. Support CleanTechnica with Just $3/Month Advertisement from Google:

"According to the UN, cities are responsible for more than 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions1 and by 2050 are expected to be home to more than two thirds of the worlds population2. It is, therefore, vital that these rapidly expanding urban hubs take proactive steps to reduce their carbon emissions and e-mobility is a key factor in achieving this. But for e-mobility to be viable in high density cities, where time is short and space is at a premium, solutions must be developed which address these challenges. ABBs latest evolution in charging technology does just that. The Terra 184 charger, the latest member of ABBs best-selling Terra family of chargers, is fast, compact, robust and provides the ability to charge up to three vehicles simultaneously3, maximizing convenience for drivers and revenue for the charging operator. With a charging power of 180kW, the Terra 184 can be used by vehicles of all sizes, be it latest or future generation private cars, buses or trucks. But unlike other high-power chargers, it comes with a footprint of less than 0.5m2, the same as the current Terra 54 model. Indeed, its innovative design means there is no need for separately installed power cabinets, offering the perfect fast and compact solution for cities with limited space. Over the last decade, ABB has laid the foundation for the future of sustainable transportation. With our latest extension to the Terra range, we have delivered against the demands of today and tomorrow, both in terms of the needs of urban areas and of the electric vehicles which frequent their roads, said Frank Muehlon, Head of ABBs global business for E-mobility Infrastructure Solutions. The Terra 184 supports all the charging standards on the market, including CCS, CHAdeMO and AC, and caters to the needs of all batteries up to 920V. It is highly customizable with features including customized credit card payment terminal, screen and cables, which have also been designed at 8 meters for maximum charging convenience. For added flexibility, operators of other Terra models such as the Terra 94 or 124, can in the future chose to upgrade their charging solution to the Terra 184 with the addition of extra power modules. The Terra 184 will be available direct from ABB and via selected ABB distributors in Europe from July, North America from August and the rest of the world by the fourth quarter of this year. It offers a safe, smart and sustainable charging solution which supports ABB Electrifications Mission to Zero, a vision for a zero-emission reality for all. ABB has unrivalled expertise in developing sustainable transport solutions. Since entering the EV-charging market a decade ago, ABB has sold more than 14,000 ABB DC fast chargers across more than 80 countries.

"Companies Posted by Staff Hitachi has announced that it has completed the procedures for its 80.1% investment in the company operating power grids business that had been carved out from ABB Ltd, pursuant to the acquisition agreement signed on December 17, 2018. The new company ,Hitachi ABB Power Grids Ltd (Hitachi ABB Power Grids) was launched and began operation on Wednesday. According to Hitachi, under the leadership of Claudio Facchinas, CEO, and Toshikazu Nishino, Executive Vice President of Hitachi, as Chairman, Hitachi ABB Power Grids will expand Hitachis energy solutions business globally as a core part of the companys Social Innovation Business. By combining world-class power grids business with Hitachis advanced digital technologies such as Lumada, Hitachi and Hitachi ABB Power Grids will provide innovative energy solutions spanning the Energy (utilities), Mobility, Smart Life (cities), Industry,and ITsectors. With roots in Hitachi and ABB, the new business will build on more than one century of expertise in pioneering engineering technologies, enabling customers to increase efficiency and maintaining resilience. It will unlock new business models and contributesocial, environmental and economic valuesfor a sustainable society. The worlds energy markets aregoing through an unprecedented transformation needed to realize the energy transition. The need for innovative energy solutionsis being driven by short-and long-term global trends. The share of renewables in the energy mix is increasing significantly and will play a key role in achieving the ambitious decarbonization targets set by countries aroundthe world. Intermittent by nature, renewable energy sources have resulted in increased complexity; while many countries have made great strides in the adoption of renewables, they now need to manage a more dynamic system, requiring increased flexibility and resilience to achieve a sustainable outcome. Many more interconnections will be required to maximize the penetration of renewables in the energy market. The rapid rise indistributed power generationand changes in consumption patterns (for example, the emergence of prosumers) are parts of this changing energy landscape. Furthermore, the growth of electric vehicles and expansion of the worldsdata centers has ramped up electricity demand. Markets related to digital utilities, such as predictive maintenance, distributed power supply and assetoptimization are expected to grow strongly. The demand for electricity continues to outpace the rising need for energy; the challenge is to meet this growing demand while minimizing environmental impact fora sustainable energy future. The new joint venture and its 36,000 employees remain committed to be the partner of choice for stronger, smarter and greener power grids. Underpinned by a customer-focused mindset and a world-class R&D organization of around 2,000 experts, the company will continue to differentiate itself through customer service, domain expertise, technology and innovation, an unparalleled global footprint and an installed base.

"ABB has introduced a new rapid charging station that will enable charging capacities of up to 180 kW. With its small footprint, the Terra 184 should be particularly suitable for use in the city and cheaper than similarly powerful models. The Swiss company estimates the required floor space at 0.5 square metres. Like the well-known Terra 54 (with up to 50 kW charging capacity), the new model should not require any additional power cabinets. These are necessary for HPC charging points but can be placed a few meters away from the actual charging point. Nevertheless, external power cabinets increase the space required and the amount of construction work. The Terra 184 should enable the simultaneous charging of three vehicles. The requirements of all standard BEV batteries are also met with a voltage of up to 920 volts. According to ABB, the charging station is compatible with all charging standards on the market. In other words, customers can order the Terra 184 with CCS, CHAdeMO and a type 2 AC cable on request. In addition, operators of other Terra models, such as the Terra 94 or 124, should be able to upgrade their charging stations to the Terra 184 status with additional power modules. In order to make the charging process as convenient as possible for the customer, the cables are designed with a length of eight meters. This is to avoid unnecessary manoeuvring in front of the charging station. ABB says that the charging station can be delivered in different configurations depending on the operator, for example with a terminal for credit card payment or an individual screen. Frank Mühlon, Head of ABBs Global E-Mobility Infrastructure Solutions, had already announced the new model in May in an interview with our German colleagues at electrive.net. The question is, how high can I go with the charging power without needing a liquid-cooled cable? Then the cables are more expensive and heavier, and above all, I have to integrate a cooling circuit, says Mühlon. In addition, the maintenance effort increases with cooling. This is why we will launch a new charging station on the market that is designed for a maximum of 180 kW and does not require liquid-cooled cables. In view of the DC charging capacities of many current vehicle models, Mühlon described the main application as being the parallel charging of two BEVs with 90 kW each. In terms of charging characteristics, this is currently completely sufficient for most vehicle types, especially in urban environments, says the ABB manager. The Terra 184 will be available directly from ABB and selected ABB dealers in Europe from this month, in North America from August and in the rest of the world from the fourth quarter of 2020. ABB has not made any mention of prices yet, but because it does not use liquid-cooled cables, the model is said to be cheaper than the Terra HP CP500 C2, which enables up to 175 kW. abb.com

"Helps customers meet future regulatory requirements, lower operating costs and increase capacity Selectively removes hydrogen sulfide, while minimizing co-absorption of carbon dioxide from gas streams LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany and HOUSTON, Texas, USA  BASF SE and ExxonMobil Catalysts and Licensing LLC have released a new highly energy efficient amine gas treatment technology named OASE sulfexx. The technology is based on a new proprietary amine-based solvent that selectively removes hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), while minimizing the co-absorption of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from gas streams. The companies jointly developed the amine-based solvent to help petroleum refiners and gas processors meet future requirements, while also increasing capacity and lowering operating costs on existing equipment. For new facilities, the use of this technology will reduce the size of the equipment and the initial capital investment compared to conventional amine gas treatment units. We are pleased to partner with BASF to develop OASE sulfexx, a compelling solution aimed at helping operators reduce emissions and lower costs, said Dan Moore, president of ExxonMobil Catalysts and Licensing, LLC. Collaborating to develop new, game-changing technologies is central to how we work, and the development of this new product provides yet another example of what we bring to the marketplace. OASE sulfexx will help our customers to achieve their sustainability goals by lowering energy consumption and reducing sulfur emissions, said Andreas Northemann, vice president of BASF Gas Treatment. The H 2 S selectivity of OASE sulfexx is outstanding  its hard to find a product on the market with that type of capability. Multiple pilot plant tests at ExxonMobil and BASF facilities have demonstrated the superior selective properties of this solvent compared to methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) formulations and FLEXSORB SE and SE Plus solvents. A commercial demonstration concluded at a tail gas treating unit located in North America further confirms the results. OASE sulfexx will help to debottleneck existing Claus tail gas treating, acid gas enrichment, and high-pressure acid gas removal units. In Claus tail gas treating units, the technology can achieve less than 10 ppmv H 2 S specifications while rejecting CO 2 to meet future emission requirements. FLEXSORB SE and SE Plus are trademarks of ExxonMobil. OASE is a registered trademark of BASF. Sulfexx is a trademark of BASF.

"The EPA says farmers can still use dicamba on their crops if they bought the herbicide before a court order banning it came into effect last week. On June 3, the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the EPAs approval of three dicamba-based herbicidesXtendiMax, from Bayer; FeXapan, from Corteva; and Engenia, from BASFeffectively banning them across the country, and causing some uproar among farmers who depend on them. In order to provide some clarity, the EPA released a cancellation order Monday, which said farmers can use any supply of the herbicides they bought before June 3, but only until July 31. They cannot sell or distribute dicamba, except to dispose of it. At the height of the growing season, the Courts decision has threatened the livelihood of our nations farmers and the global food supply, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a press release. Todays cancellation and existing stocks order is consistent with EPAs standard practice following registration invalidation, and is designed to advance compliance, ensure regulatory certainty, and to prevent the misuse of existing stocks. Dicamba is a commonly used herbicide which kills broad-leafed weeds. Farmers spray it on crops that have been genetically modified to be dicamba-resistant, but the herbicide has a tendency to drift onto neighboring farms, causing significant damage to non-resistant produce. In its decision, the appeals court found that the EPA had failed to understand the danger of dicamba when it extended its approval for the herbicide in 2018. The court determined that this extension violated the Endangered Species Act, as well as the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.

"ABB has been selected by Vigor Fab LLC to provide hybrid-electric propulsion and energy storage system solutions for the newest additions to the Washington State Ferry fleet, setting the largest U.S. ferry system on course for zero-emission operations The new Olympic Class ferries, which will have the capacity to carry 144 cars and 1,500 passengers each, are an important part of Washington States plans for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fuel use. On delivery in 2024, the initial vessel in the series will be the first newbuild in Washington State Ferrys fleet to feature hybrid-electric propulsion and a high capacity energy storage system. The new vessels will be able to fully operate on battery power and will have the capability to revert to hybrid mode, if required. This landmark project supports Washington States goal for 2050 to reduce emissions by 57.5 percent below the emissions level in 2019, utilizing a hybrid and electric propulsion solution that is space-efficient, easy to install and flexible in operation, said Jay Hebert, Vice President  Marine Fabrication, Vigor. Vigor is delighted to partner with ABB in this remarkable work prompted by the commitment of Washington Governor Jay Inslee, the state legislature and Washington State Ferries to replace aging ferries with clean technology in alignment with the states commitment to environmental stewardship. Leveraging ABBs Onboard DC Grid power distribution system and proven drive technology, the new ferry design will optimize energy use, whether drawing on main engine power, battery power or a combination of the two. The battery power can also extend zero-emissions capability along the supply chain by using renewables and hydroelectric power. Moving towards a zero-emission future relies on technologies that meet the environmental and cost needs of today  and offer flexibility to integrate future energy sources in the years ahead, said Juha Koskela, Managing Director, ABB Marine & Ports. ABB is delighted to support this milestone project demonstrating the way that electric, digital and connected solutions can deliver shippings zero-emission future. Washington State Ferries is the largest ferry system in the U.S. By 2040, the Washington Ferry System plan is to replace 13 existing diesel ferries with hybrid-electric newbuilds and to convert six other ferries to plug-in hybrid, with recharging capacity installed at many ferry terminals. All hybrid vessels will be capable of charging at the terminal, and some of the vessels will be capable of operating in fully electric mode on shorter routes. With the addition of newer-built, clean energy ferries to the fleet, fuel consumption is projected at 9.5 million gallons in 2040, compared to 19 million gallons in 2018, with CO2 emissions expected to fall below 2050 reduction targets by 2034. Vigor builds WSF ferries at its Harbor Island shipyard in Seattle and says that, in addition to environmental and transportation benefits, construction of new ferries generates family-wage jobs and has other positive economic impacts. Each ferry build produces up to 560 direct jobs and a total of 1,300 direct, indirect and induced jobs, and the states Office of Financial Management has calculated that each $75 million invested in ferries produces $90 million in economic activity.

"MUMBAI : A day after it downgraded India's sovereign rating to the lowest level, global credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Services on Tuesday downgraded the ratings of major Indian companies to negative. The companies include-- Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL), Oil India Limited (OIL), Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), Petronet LNG Limited (PLL), Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS), Infosys Limited (Infosys). In addition, Moody's has affirmed the long-term issuer ratings of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) to negative from stable while the outlooks for UPL Corporation Limited (UPL Corp) and Genpact Limited (Genpact) remains stable. Under Moody's joint default analysis approach for government-related issuers (GRIs) like ONGC, OIL, IOCL and and BPCL, government support is one of the key considerations. The ratings of these four GRIs are very sensitive to a decline in the rating of their government owner given their close links with the Government of India, Moody's said in a statement, adding that as a result, each GRI has been downgraded by one notch, consistent with the downgrade of the sovereign rating. For downgrade of HPCL and PLL, Moody's said that HPCL's rating incorporates Moody's expectation of support from the Government of India through ONGC, and has accordingly also been downgraded following the rating action on the sovereign and ONGC. The downgrade of PLL with a negative outlook follows the rating actions on its key counterparts, including IOCL and BPCL. Ratings of TCS and Infosys are constrained to no more than two notches above the sovereign rating. The sovereign downgrade to Baa3 negative therefore results in the rating downgrades of TCS and Infosys to Baa1 negative from A3 negative. ""The affirmation of RIL's Baa2 issuer rating reflects Moody's view that its credit metrics remain appropriately positioned for its rating. The change in RIL's outlook to negative from stable is in line with the downgrade of the Indian sovereign rating with a negative outlook and reiterates Moody's view that it cannot be rated more than one notch above the Indian sovereign,"" said a Moody's statement. The affirmation of the Baa3 issuer ratings with a stable outlook for UPL and Genpact reflects Moody's view that these entities can be rated one notch above the Indian sovereign.

"First new mode of action classification from the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee (HRAC) since 1985 Luximo soon to provide farmers in the EU and UK a much-needed tool against grass weed resistance Limburgerhof, Germany  In the ongoing effort to combat weed resistance, unique modes of action are critical to protecting crops and the food sources of a growing population. Researchers at BASF dedicated to finding viable solutions to this challenge arrived at Luximo, a herbicide which has received the first new mode of action classification from the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee (HRAC) since 1985. Already approved for sale in Australia in 2019, BASF also expects farmers in the EU and UK to benefit from this much-needed herbicide in the future. Providing farmers with a new tool like Luximo  the first new herbicide mode of action in nearly 35 years  is an exciting moment for the whole industry and will offer growers the opportunity to overcome resistance of the most troublesome grass weeds in their cropping systems, stated Rex Liebl, Global Product Development Herbicides at BASFs Agricultural Solutions division. Luximo is an essential complement to the weed management toolbox. It is designed to become the backbone of effective and sustainable grass weed management programs, where rotating multiple modes of action is essential to fight resistance. Due to its novel mode of action, Luximo has no known cross-resistance. It provides soil residual control against a broad range of grasses in cereal crops, including resistant and difficult to control black-grass and ryegrass. Luximo is the first active ingredient in the new HRAC mode of action class Group Q or 30, which stands for the inhibition of the enzyme family Fatty Acid Thioesterase (FAT). These enzymes are vital for plant cell membrane development and function. Their inhibition disrupts germination and thus the emergence of grass weeds. The HRAC is an international body founded by the agrochemical industry, helping to protect crop yields and quality worldwide by supporting efforts in the fight against herbicide-resistant weeds. By collecting, assessing and sharing information on weed resistance, the HRAC acts as a comprehensive and reliable source for those who feed a growing population. More information on HRAC as well as the new HRAC mode of action poster, including Luximo, can be found here. Early success stories of farmers using the Luximo herbicide can be found here.

"BEML is firming up tie-ups with two foreign companies for setting up joint manufacturing facilities in India. The company has also called for global expressions of interest (EoIs) for more tie-ups as part of its efforts to indigenise technology. These planned units will be set up in its Make in India Park. The tie-up with a Czech firm was for spare parts and the other with a Japanese firm was for propulsion. Tie-ups through the EoIs will be for products that complement BEML's existing products. State-run Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL), too, is seeking tie-ups with foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for jointly setting up manufacturing facilities.

"PLANT breeder BASF, already well known in the Australian breeding sector for its canola lines, has officially named its first Aussie wheat variety. BASF and its commercial partner Seednet announced this week that growers will have access to the new variety, Ascot, as of next year. It was developed at BASF's wheat and oilseed breeding centre at Longerenong, near Horsham in Victoria. The milling wheat is currently undergoing quality classification. At present it has APW classification but breeders are hopeful that with further testing that may even push into the Australian Hard (AH) bracket. It is designed for growing in high rainfall zones (HRZs). Trials were conducted by Australian Grain and Forage (AGF) Seeds at Smeaton in Victoria's Central Highlands region and officials expect the variety will do well in other similar cold, wet environments, such as NSW's southern slopes and South Australia's south-eastern region. Yields for the variety were excellent in trials and BASF and Seednet are hopeful of good uptake. Seednet national manager Simon Crane said the variety had showed best potential in long season or irrigated scenarios. ""It is certainly capable of yielding really well in the right environment,"" Mr Crane said. BASF is planning for Ascot to be just the first of many lines to come out of its Longerenong facility. Rob Hall, seeds and traits business head Asia Pacific, BASF said several new lines would hit the market in coming years. ""We look forward to producing a range of exciting wheat varieties in the next few years,"" Mr Hall said. BASF is already well established as an Australian breeder of canola seed, with several ground-breaking hybrid varieties with innovative traits such as PodGuard and TruFlex under the InVigor brand.

While we haven't completed our review of the updated model, it will again fall into consideration as one of the best cheap gaming laptops with its starting price of $599.99. The biggest change for those that may have taken a look at the Nitro 5 last year is the reduction in screen size from 17.3 inches to a much more manageable 15.6 inches, which should also help with the bulky size of the laptop that was one of our reviewer's few complaints with the 2019 Nitro 5.

"Covid-19 has prompted the development of mining solutions and innovations which can revolutionise the industry and continue optimising its functionality even in the post-pandemic period. Yoana Cholteeva speaks to ABB about the digital solutions the company has already put in place and the future outlook on remote working in mining. Yoana Cholteeva (YC): How important is remote connectivity in mining during the Covid-19 outbreak? Max Luedtke (ML): Remote connectivity and operation have been important trends in mining for some time, due to safety, declining ore resources, and, of course, operational optimisation. Minimising unplanned and costly downtime through predicting the upcoming maintenance needs of equipment, as well as labour, travel and electricity costs is key. Remote asset condition monitoring is well established. Many of the thousands of production assets in mines and mineral processing plants have embedded tools to collect and store asset condition data. Digital applications are already employed to remotely monitor the condition of these with a complete online view of automation, instrumentation, electrical, mechanical or process equipment. This allows specific maintenance-oriented algorithms to help predict possible equipment failures and notify mine operators of the need to resolve this and thereby avoid costly downtime. Another key remote capability is augmented reality (AR) which overlays computer-generated information, data, images, video, or other content onto the real-world environment through smart glasses or mixed reality devices. This enables a field service technician to share their view of a situation using the devices camera and communicate directly with an expert via on-screen annotations, chat, and document sharing without that expert being on site. Covid-19 Report  Updated twice a week Understanding the Covid-19 outbreak, the economic impact and implications for specific sectors Get the free report Our parent business intelligence company YC: What kind of remote services and digital solutions does ABB provide for mining? ML: ABB Ability Asset Vista Condition Monitoring for mining is a digital application that enables mine operators to evaluate precise maintenance needs in mines by pulling together previously disparate data about the condition of various production equipment. It offers operations, automation, and maintenance personnel in the mining industry a complete overview of their production assets condition, helping to increase process efficiency, avoid unnecessary maintenance, reduce exposure to hazardous areas and improve time to repair. One example of remote servicing is ABBs Ability Remote Insights which is a new AR platform designed to improve response times, extend asset lifecycles, improve production performance through increased availability and productivity, and ensure operational excellence. Introduced in October 2019 at the Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific EXPO in Singapore, ABB Ability Remote Insights has been developed for use in multiple industry sectors including metals and mining. We are increasingly moving towards mixed reality, and ABB has been working to implement it into operations. For example, we have created a mixed reality environment for the Gearless Mill Drive, which we are working on implementing in actual mining operations for training, maintenance, and troubleshooting. This means someone can sit in an office using a mixed reality device along with a member of personnel on site in a remote location, and working together they can share documentation and expertise from thousands of miles apart. Do you see impact on recruitment in your company due to COVID-19 pandemic? Increased hiring No impact Recruitment on hold Lay-offs expected Lay-off announced View Results Loading ... Loading ... YC: What advice would you give to mining operators currently trying to improve their remote services and staff training process? ML: Weve seen that mining companies with a culture that fosters innovation and encourages new ways of thinking and openness to new ideas have had a great deal of success with the transition to remote services and operations. This comes from management and can be a mind-set shift from a traditional way of thinking in mining. The integration of operations technology (OT) and information technology (IT) is key. Integrating OT and IT so that data flows seamlessly between operational systems and business systems enables new capabilities such as process optimisation, predictive maintenance, asset management, and data-driven decision making, as well as remote operations and maintenance. ABB Ability Operations Management System improves responsiveness to unplanned events and reduces production variability through all the mine stages by integrating short interval control and closed loop scheduling into a single digital platform. This helps mine operators and planners make better decisions faster, ensuring ongoing operation of the mine and increased productivity. Equipment availability is also improved by moving from a reactive to a predictive maintenance model. The shifting skill profile is an important consideration  hardware service technicians remain critical, but workers increasingly need digital and planning skills, and as mines evolve in other ways, understanding concepts of, say, electrification, also becomes important. ABB can help with training of staff and also uses digital technologies to deliver training services to upskill people in maintenance. YC: Do you think things will go back to normal or will working remotely become the new normal and carry on expanding? ML: Digital transformation is a journey. Companies have started and will continue to reinvent themselves through digital technologies that enable seamless deployment of continuous, reliable, and scalable processes at an optimised cost. Aligning people, process, data, and tools is allowing businesses to achieve excellence and deliver safe, dependable, and profitable production. Remote operations are a natural extension of the digital mine and a move to remote-enabled solutions is only likely to accelerate and become more established in the current climate. YC: Are there any jobs, taking mining as an example, where remote working will never be possible, or will technology eventually overcome these hurdles? ML: Internet infrastructure and capacity is the backbone to remote connectivity and as we are all discovering, working from home can be as important to invest in within cities as in the remote areas in which many mines are situated. People still need to meet each other in business. Site operation and specialist technician roles will still be essential. We may see a shift to more remote operations and with it a skill set shift, but there will be a combination of on-site and remote personnel, not one extreme or another. Digital presently does not complete the majority of mechanical maintenance, but with improvement, acceptance, and new robotic applications, this will improve as costs come down.

"ARCs Research Director, Mark Sen Gupta, recently interviewed Matilda Steiner-Arvidsson, Global Product Manager for Manufacturing Operations Management Solutions, with ABB. They discussed the challenges of operator procedures, customer expectations, keeping pace with trends, and how ABBs recently released Ability Augmented Field Procedures solution addresses all of these. This blog captures the key points of their conversation. You can also listen to this podcast here. Responding to Customer Requirements Marks opening query was What prompted you to create this product? What did your customers tell you? ABB works with a wide range of customers across both process and energy industries, and one thing they have in common is the drive for improving operational performance, said Matilda. Further, she said that when executing manual procedures, human errors emerge as the main challenge. Even in highly automated operations there are some areas that rely on manual execution, and when people are involved, errors are likely to happen. Although standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to mitigate errors, avoid unnecessary downtimes and safety incidents, these are not always followed. So, the main challenge remains in finding ways to reduce human errors. Customers are looking for a more integrated and flexible approach to SOPs to reduce the possibility of making mistakes by working on the right asset, in the right sequence, and doing the right things, she said. Another challenge that ABBs customers mention is a lack of real-time information when they are out in the field. What they expect is reliable real-time information, field work synchronized with the control system, and simplified collaboration between the field operator and control room operator. Changes in the Last Ten Years Mark said that these are not new issues and several companies have provided solutions to address these. So, what has changed in the last ten years? Matilda agreed that these are not new issues. But what has changed in the last ten years is technology. And two things that have significantly helped this course are: mobility (industrial grade tablets, smartphones, and emergence of wearables, like HoloLens); and the combination of industrial Wi-fi and IT. Mobility has emerged as a megatrend in the industrial space, as it provides connectivity for operators, she added. How ABBs Ability Augmented Field Procedures Solution Solves These Problems The Augmented Field Procedure mobile app (tablet, smart phone) is a step change in the way work is done from the traditional paper-driven way, explained Matilda. The operator gets an up-to-date view on the scheduled jobs and step-by-step assistance when executing the procedures. So, theres no hassle about latest versions or having it copied and distributed. In addition to that, on the mobile app, the operator also has easy access to supporting information (pictures and manuals) and can leverage the built-in camera to take pictures of the procedural steps or QR code to ensure that the work is being done properly. Further, she said that the core capability of the solution is integration to the control system. The operator gets real-time field information to capture values automatically and is able to interact with the control system to execute procedures in a synchronized manner. This improves work efficiency and reduces the need to have back and forth radio communication between the control room and field. While the solution supports the users, it also ensures that the work is done in the right way. It has features, like voice synthesis and an industrial chatbot, to support the operators too. In this context, Matilda spoke about the HoloLens application that has capabilities similar to that of mobile apps, but in addition, it also has augmented reality (AR). This enables hands-free operations and see field data in the augmented context of the physical area of their view. This is an eye-opener and very powerful when it comes to work and training, she said. Further, Matilda said that HoloLens could be used for remote consultation. The offering includes insights and facilitates collaboration with offsite experts and enables integration with other applications. Responding to Customer Needs Traditionally, these solutions take a lot of effort to implement. Has ABB addressed this aspect? And what about large companies vs. small, single site users? asked Mark. One clear customer requirement is a high degree of self-service, said Matilda. So, the workflow is simplified and can be done without an ABB expert on site. The customer also has the option of using preconfigured templates that can be reused as building blocks. She explained that this enables enterprise-level and global rollouts and supports sharing procedures across sites and delivering comprehensive global solutions. Current Installations Matilda said that current installations include customers in the chemicals space. The main objective is to improve operational procedures; to do things in the right sequence with the control systems. This will help to avoid errors and ensure that procedures are correctly followed; and also reduce the need for communication with the control room.

"Back in February, at ISE 2020, we first talked about our new cloud-based subscription platform Barco Insights. Efficiency, reliability and flexibility at the core of remote projector management, that was our promise. Further roll-out of the Barco Insights packages and new features will become gradually available throughout 2020. But the first stage, Barco Insights Monitor, is already standard available on our UDM projectors today. Discover the three ways how it can change your projector management forever. Cloud-based storage of projectors usage data and light source runtimes Do you want to know how many hours your projector has been switched on, or how long its light source has been running? The Barco Insights platform saves two weeks of runtime data. It allows you to keep an eye on your projectors lifetime. And when youre managing an entire fleet of rental devices, the automated cloud-based storage of such information will cut down manual administration between different projects. Real-time information on environmental conditions The Barco projectors have sensors which detect the current ambient temperature and ambient humidity. These factors have a strong effect on the overall performance of the projector and on the devices aging progress. The Barco Insights dashboard gives live information on operating and environmental conditions. It also includes a two-week history graph displaying all changes in temperature and humidity while the projector was switched on and connected to the cloud. Set the flex brightness value in the cloud Barcos UDM and UDX offer the unique Flex² solution. The integrated feature allows you to tune and lock the projectors brightness and resolution for a specific project. Rental companies can cover a wider range of shows with fewer projectors in their fleet, and other ProAV installations benefit from the increased versatility this feature brings to their investment. The Barco Insights platform now gives you the ability to configure the Flex² brightness value in the cloud at any time and wherever you are. Extra advantages * To make these functionalities available on your projector, registration and activation is required first. You can find more details here The free Barco Insights Monitor license even has some more additional features to offer. You can take custom notes on a specific projector, e.g. mentions of damages or additional runtime information, and save it in the cloud to facilitate the QA process. So no more error-prone e-mails with serial numbers, or post-its on flight cases. And the online platform gives a central view of what firmware your projector fleet is on, enabling quick insights into which device is up-to-date and which ones still need to be upgraded.

"Metsä Fibre, part of Metsä Group, signed a preliminary agreement with ABB to supply electricity systems to the bioproduct mill in Kemi, Finland. The degree of Finnish origin for the delivery is high, more than 60%. It is estimated that for the entire Metsä Fibre bioproduct mill project the domestic content will be approximately 70%. The delivery that has been agreed between ABB and Metsä Fibre includes a significant amount of electrification and drives technology that is developed and manufactured in Finland at ABBs facilities in Vaasa and Helsinki. The preliminary agreement with ABB Finland includes the electrical systems for the entire bioproduct mill, as well as installations from high-voltage grid to mills internal electricity distribution system and electric motors. The value of the total delivery that has now been agreed would be approximately Euro 40 million. The total investment of the Metsä Fibres bioproduct mill is approximately Euro 1.5 billion. In addition to ABB, three other main partners have already been selected for the bioproduct mill project. Valmet would supply all the main equipment and automation, Fimpec would be the contractor for civil construction, and AFRY would be responsible for the engineering of the construction phase. Metsä Fibre has had long and successful cooperation with the aforementioned partners on projects that are strategically important to the company, such as the Äänekoski bioproduct mill project in Finland. Metsä Groups Kemi bioproduct mill project is progressing in many fronts, for example through financing negotiations and the development of the logistics needed for the new mill. Preparatory work is ongoing at the mill area in Kemi to ensure the smooth start of bioproduct mill construction immediately after the investment decision has been made. The investment decision is expected to be made earliest in the autumn of 2020 as the environmental permit process is completed. The Kemi bioproduct mill would produce annually 1.5 million tonnes of softwood and hardwood pulp, as well as numerous other bioproducts. It would employ approximately 250 people directly at the mill area in Kemi, and approximately 2,500 in its entire direct value chain in Finland. This is around 1,500 employees more than the current pulp mill. The bioproduct mills annual use of pulpwood, mainly procured in Finland, would be approximately 7.6 million cubic metres, 4.5 million cubic metres more than the present pulp mill. Metsä Fibre is a leading producer of bioproducts, biochemicals and bioenergy.

"ABBs new AXR Large AC motors offer power-dense design for hazardous locations Press release | Zürich, Switzerland | 2019-08-14 The AXR 5000 and 5800 Large AC NEMA motors deliver an average of 15 percent more power over conventional designs. They also meet American Petroleum Institute 541 and 547 standards for motors operating in the oil and gas industry. ABBs AXR 5000 and 5800 motors offer more HP (horse power) per pound than conventional TEFC (totally enclosed fan cooled) motors but with a smaller frame size in some power ratings. This helps save space, up to 8 inches in overall length in some cases, which enables more compact installations on oil platforms and in refineries. The new AXR motors also offer improved cooling, a critical factor to extend the life of the motor. An internal cooling loop circulates air inside the motor, moving heat to the frame. An external fan blows air over the frame to remove the heat. The new cooling configuration offers a more thermally equalized motor, eliminating hot spots that have been seen in TEFC motors, says Charles Blankenship, Large AC Motor Product Manager, ABB. Better cooling reduces the thermal stresses on the insulation system, which helps improve the motors longevity. As the main terminal box and auxiliary box can be mounted in several positions, installation and maintenance are easy. This also means fewer spares are needed, which saves money. The rigid frame increases stability so that the motor can meet the stringent API vibration limit specifications. AXR motors also feature sleeve bearings that operate at cooler temperatures, last longer and are easy to maintain. These motors are available with up to an IP56 rating, for protection against contaminates and dust ingress. ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a pioneering technology leader with a comprehensive offering for digital industries. With a history of innovation spanning more than 130 years, ABB is today a leader in digital industries with four customer-focused, globally leading businesses: Electrification, Industrial Automation, Motion, and Robotics & Discrete Automation, supported by its common ABB Ability digital platform. ABBs market?leading Power Grids business will be divested to Hitachi in 2020. ABB operates in more than 100 countries with about 147,000 employees.

Haul road electrification technology has been in development for decades, but the emergence of a new generation of diesel-electric trucks that already have an electrical system on board to tap into  making it easy to attach them on a trolley line  means the concept has recently begun to gain significant traction as a commercially viable way to facilitate the all-electric mines of the future. One of the key challenges when it comes to reducing diesel fuel usage is cycle times. There is no technology today that enables miners to fill the trucks tank and complete a shift without stopping; either you have to increase the speed of the mobile equipment or the size the fleet itself  both of which have a direct impact on capital expenditure. Trolley assist systems have returned to the market in the last two to three years in places such as North and South America, Africa and Turkey, mainly due to CO2 emission taxes, the removal of tax advantages from diesel, and premiums offered by energy suppliers to incentivise companies to use electricity. Going forward, there are many synergies with using trolley lines, which offer huge benefits in terms of CO2 reduction. Large trucks regularly carry 3,000-5,000 litres of diesel in the tank and consume around 300-400 litres per hour while travelling up a 17 km ramp in half an hour. By going electric, the vehicles, when on-trolley, only use around 30-50 litres an hour, which equates to a reduction in diesel consumption of as much as 350 litres an hour, making operations much more CO2 efficient. In addition, the speed of the trucks will increase, meaning you have a higher throughput at the mine. Operators can also start to think about parking some of their fleet, which will bring additional indirect value to overall operational improvements through better maintenance planning to improve fleet availability and fleet longevity. One example of the revival of trolley assist systems is at the Aitik open-pit copper mine in Sweden. Here Boliden, ABB and partners trialled the electrification of four haulage trucks on a 700 m trolley line, with the goal of reducing annual diesel usage by 800,000 litres and carrying 70 Mt of ore every year at the mine without using fossil fuel. Reduced diesel consumption at Boliden mines Boliden has now moved on from the 700 m trolley line trial at Aitik to confirming it will install an additional 3 km of trolley line at the mine, plus 1.8 km at Kevitsa (in addition to the accompanying conversion of diesel-electric haul trucks). By doing so, Boliden says it will reduce its diesel consumption by 5,500 cu.m/y when its investment is complete. That is a big number. Aitik is currently the only mine in an arctic climate where electric trolley has been installed. Overall, with the further three kilometres of electric trolley line, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation over the life of mine are reduced by nearly 15%. In Kevitsa, 13 mining trucks are converted for electric trolley lines at the same time as the 1.8-km-long electric trolley line is being built. The investment means that greenhouse gas emissions over the life of this mine will be reduced by 9%. In addition, productivity gains are added as the electrically powered trucks can run at a higher speed, and the working environment for the drivers is also improved, not least through lower noise levels. Todays mine design Diesel-electric trucks have an electrical powertrain in the wheels, meaning they can be driven fully electric, and have an electrical genset on board, so they generate electricity as they go. However, due to the limitations of existing battery technologies at surface mines, we cannot yet manage large payload trucks of 280-400 tons (254-363 t) fully battery equipped. Companies are therefore trying to close the gap between the trolley and the loading or dumping point using battery packs and other solutions. Constraint management The transformation from diesel to electric is bringing new advantages in terms of CO2 reduction but also new constraints in terms of mine planning and fleet management. Energy costs represent almost one third of a mining companys total cost base; helping industry to manage these costs is therefore key. Switching OEMs on to electrification Having initially adopted a fast follower approach to new digital technologies, the risk-averse mining sector has also been slow to embrace electrification. Operators are looking to technology leaders such as ABB as well as more niche players to make change happen. A lot of mining companies are looking to the likes of ABB to influence mining equipment manufacturers and engage them in the electric transformation, and so accelerate the process. A clear technology roadmap and shifting workforce skill are key to this transition. The biggest challenge is that customers are nervous about redesigning existing diesel-powered mines to integrate new electrification systems. Asset lifecycle strategies, ownership models and duty cycles are all subject to change. Ultimately, the customer needs a very clear technology roadmap and finding the right partner for this major undertaking is key. According to Accentures resources practice, the profile of the future mining workforce could change by up to 80% by 2024, driven by increased adoption of advanced technologies. The onus is therefore on mining companies to demonstrate a progressive commitment to electrification to attract and retain the next generation of digitally literate talent. Today the worldwide situation with COVID-19 may accelerate these changes faster than forecast. Current skill sets will have to be re-evaluated for the all-electric mines of the future, and so the need for change management is key. Tomorrow we will need more workers understanding the concept of electrification, in addition to digital and planning skills  so the shifting skill profile is an important consideration. *Mehrzad Ashnagaran is Global Product Line Manager Electrification at ABB, while Michel Serres is VP Innovation and Digital North America at ABB

"Swedish industrial giant ABB established its first manufacturing joint venture in China in 1992. Since then, it has invested more than 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in the country. Zhang Zhiqiang, managing director of ABB China told CGTN that the coronavirus pandemic hasn't shaken up the company's confidence in China, and it will continue its investment. Zhang said that China is among the most favorable markets for foreign investment. He revealed that China serves as ABB's second biggest market, where more than 90 percent of sales come from local production. The following are excerpts from the interview, where Zhang talks about the Foreign Investment Law, and elaborates on ABB's take on industrial chain restructuring in the post-epidemic era. CGTN: Has ABB felt any of the changes brought by the Foreign Investment Law? Like equal treatment of domestic and foreign companies and intellectual property protection? Zhang: We enjoy the same treatment in the cities where we're operating, like in Xiamen, Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. We have been treated fairly and, actually, whenever we have a problem, the government will help us out. In case we need to expand our factory to get more workers from other cities, we got support from the local government, so we were able to move our factory, like in Xiamen, from the old Xiamen city into the new area, before building three 400,000 square meters factories for ABB in a very short time, which became the biggest in the world. And on IP protection, I think that's a very good progress we have made in the country. 20 or 30 years ago, as a foreign company, you encountered a lot of counterfeits, you had to go through a lot of legal battles, and you would find copycats everywhere in the country. It's getting a lot better, as we can hardly see any of these direct copies of products as we speak. On one side,we have a very strict law; on the other side, innovation happens in different companies, which fuels competition. People are competing on the capability rather than just copying another product. I think that's a very, very good development in China. CGTN: How do you make of the argument that multinationals will shift industrial chain out of China in the post-epidemic era? Does ABB have such plans? Zhang: Well, I mean ABB is very well positioned. We have established our supply chain for the local market. The factories in Europe mainly supply the European demand. We have factories in America that mainly supply the U.S. and Canada, and the American market. With China, India, mainly for the local market, and for Southeast Asia as well, I think that structure is the best for industrial companies. For key medical, national security, high voltage products,medical equipment and ventilators, they are probably going to see this emergency 'I need it in my country.' I am willing to pay the extra cost for that emergency,so I see that product as a possibility. But the general products, I mean furniture, clothes, shoes, leather bags; I think by the end of the day, it's still the cost. I do not believe people will move everything into a different country, and for that token, I also think automation will help. If the Chinese company, if they also do similar things, like putting up a factory in North America for the American market, put a factory in Europe for the European market, with robots that will help reduce the cost of labor and, at the same time, you overcome the geographic risk for that market. I think that would be the best solution, so it will be the most competitive company that will win.

An official statement from the HPCL authorities reassured locals that the emission was a normal flue gas with steam. Speaking about the incident with Yo! Vizag, Mr. M Kali, Manager of PR and CSR at HPCL stated that residents have no reason to worry as the smoke was released as part of a regular procedure. A momentary imbalance in combustion at one of the stacks led to the excessive smoke and steam release around 3:10 PM on Thursday. We want to reassure the citizens that this is part of the regular procedure, and the situation was completely brought under control in 3-4 minutes. No staff member or resident around the refinery was affected as the smoke wasnt dangerous. Further, the officer said that the gas emitted from the HPCL refinery in Vizag was just flue gas and steam. This process is just like vehicles emitting smoke while the engine starts. There is nothing to worry about it. The situation is settled in and around the plant and regular operations commenced within five minutes of the smoke being released, said the officer. Videos and images of thick smoke being emitted from the refinery soon went viral on social media with worried citizens asking the officials to provide clarification on the same. The latest response from the companys officials therefore comes as a sigh of relief, especially in the areas surrounding the refinery.

"Mumbai: Amid back-to-back investments in Jio Platforms and fund raise by Reliance Industries, including Indias biggest rights issue till date, the Mukesh Ambani companys stock has remained under-owned among domestic mutual funds.While the big slump in oil market may have nudged fund houses to steer clear of the stock in the previous months, April saw them come back to the counter in a big way.Reliance Industries (RIL) was among the most sought-after stocks among domestic fund managers during the month, when Dalal Street staged a spectacular rebound from the brutal March selloff, giving benchmarks Sensex and Nifty nearly 15 per cent lift.These indices had eroded around 21 per cent each in March.Besides RIL, fund houses also lapped up shares from telecom, consumption, pharma and auto sectors, picking up early signs of revival in some of these sectors. They, however, remained focused mainly on largecaps.At the same time, engineering and construction major Larsen & Toubro was conspicuous as their biggest sell candidate during the month. Analysts said worries over a crippling slowdown that stares at the economy may have turned investors cautious on the stock, usually considered best proxy play on Indias growth.Fund managers also mostly shunned lenders amid rising worries over a possible spike in bad loans. Yet, Nifty Bank rose over 12 per cent during the month.Here is a list of most bought ad most sold largecap stocks by mutual funds in April:Investment flows to equity funds slowed down in April amid the Covid-induced lockdown. Net flows crashed to Rs 6,212.96 crore from Rs 11,723 crore in March.Large and multicap funds, which had seen increased investor interest in March could not sustain the momentum. With inflows dropping, domestic institutional investors comprising mainly mutual funds and insurance companies, turned net sellers on Dalal Street, pulling out a net of Rs 824 crore in April after pumping in Rs 55,595.18 crore in March.RIL was the top buy among mutual funds, as they put in Rs 780.51 crore in the index heavyweight, data from mutual fund tracker Value Research showed. The bet seems to have paid off well for fund managers, as the stock has risen 17.6 per cent in last one month, smartly outperforming benchmark Sensex, which declined 4.94 per cent in the same period.Telecom major Bharti Airtel was the second stock in the pecking order, drawing in Rs 736.43 crore of mutual fund money in April.The outlook for the telecom firm has improved through the Covid crisis, as investors anticipated a surge in use of telecom and internet services as the pandemic demanded social distancing and triggered behavioural change.Also, the intense competition in the domestic telecom industry has gradually reduced. Given the current scenario, Bharti Airtel is likely to enjoy further market share as another key player, Voda Idea, struggles to survive in the market, said analysts at brokerage Anand Rathi.The third favourite stock turned out to be FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL). Fund managers invested a net of Rs 551.95 crore on this stock during the month.On May 8, UBS raised its rating on HUL to buy from neutral, and increased target price to Rs 2,400 from Rs 2,150 earlier.We believe HULs agility and channel dominance will enable it to recover faster than peers as the lockdown eases. The cost focus it has demonstrated should benefit minority shareholders, UBS said.While valuations still look somewhat expensive, we believe the negative catalyst around the stake sale surplus is now behind us, the brokerage said.Fund managers sold Rs 753.80 crore worth of share in engineering and construction major L&T. The stock has been underperforming the broader market in recent times.They also heavily sold shares of private banks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Bandhan Bank. BSE Bankex has been the most-impacted sectoral index so far this year, having eroded 45.10 per cent value for the year to date, BSE Sensex is down 27.21 per cent for this period.

"New Delhi: Vedanta group firm Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) on Thursday reported a 33.4 per cent decline in net profit to Rs 1,339 crore for the quarter ended March 31. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 2,012 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2018-19, Hindustan Zinc Ltd said in a filing to the BSE. Its total income declined to Rs 4,861 crore in the January-March quarter, compared with Rs 6,030 crore in the year-ago period. HZL Chief Executive Officer Sunil Duggal said, ""Industrial activity across the globe is undergoing a level of disruption never seen since the Second World War. In these challenging times, our focus is business continuity and safety of people and operations and supporting our communities affected by the pandemic."" He added that the company has ramped up its operations back to normal levels and is confident of delivering good performance in 2020-21. Its Chief Financial Officer Swayam Saurabh said the company is accelerating its sustainable cost-reduction programmes and finding new opportunities to control costs and conserve capital in rapidly-evolving ecosystems. ""We are confident to emerge stronger from the current economic crisis and generate superior returns for our shareholders,"" he said. The company said it has taken a pro-active approach to keep its assets and people safe while increasing engagement with its communities during these difficult times of COVID-19. The company's operations were halted from March 22 and most employees were encouraged to work from home, barring some who attended the call for duty to keep production assets safe including critical care and maintenance. To ensure business continuity, a committee 'COVID-19 Response War Room' was created to identify and implement critical business decisions to restart mines and plants in a safe manner and ramp up while ensuring restoration of supply chain. ""We gradually restarted our operations from April 8 and all our mines and smelters were operational in a couple of weeks. In April 2020, we ramped up our mines and smelters to 40 per cent and 80 per cent of capacity, respectively,"" the statement said. The company's mined metal production for the quarter was up two per cent year-on-year to 2,49,000 tonnes despite operations shutdown from March 22 onwards due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown. Owning to uncertainty around ongoing lockdowns and business disruption risk, it said, ""We are deferring guidance for 2020-21 to the end of the first quarter. Our current focus remains around sustaining normal level of productions, active management of costs and capital conservation.""

"Mumbai The first day when Reliance Industries  Rights Entitlement (RIL-RE) issue opened today, the online trading in RIL-RE reached high volumes with buyers outpacing sellers and the price soaring. According to sources, RIL-RE issue became the first issue where eligible shareholders got the rights entitlements (REs) in demat, which could be traded on stock exchanges. Reliance RE price soared 39.5 per cent to Rs 212 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Sources said that Reliance RE had more volumes than the RIL share itself. Throughout the day, Reliance RE traded at a premium to its intrinsic value  or the difference between RILs CMP and the Rights Issue price of Rs 1,257. This shows great demand for RILs REs in the secondary market. This also shows that REs have created great value for RIL shareholders. The details regarding traded volume are: NSE recorded 2.92 crore volume with a traded value of Rs 537.1 crore. BSE recorded 27.4 lakh volume with a traded value of Rs 51.8 crore. Together nearly 3.2 crore Reliance REs were traded on both the stock exchanges together worth Rs 588.9 crore. Sources said the traded volume in RIL REs on the debut day of 3.2 crore was greater than the share of Reliance Industries  2.55 crore RIL shares exchanged hands on the NSE and 9.08 lakh on BSE, totalling 2.64 crore. The details regarding price are  the price of Reliance RE, which debuted at Rs 158.05, reached a peak of Rs 212 by end of the day on NSE  just below the daily circuit limit of Rs 212.65. This marked a gain of 39.5 per cent. The gain was greater than the increase in RIL share of 2.02 per cent with a closing price of Rs 1,437.40, said sources. Reliance REs traded at a premium to their intrinsic value  or the difference between RILs share price and the Rights Issue price of Rs 1,257. At market close, the RE traded at Rs 212 and RIL share traded at Rs 1,437.40, which is at a differential of Rs 180.4 over Rs 1,257. This premium is generated because of the 18-month period RIL has given to the eligible shareholders to pay for the rights shares. A premium to the intrinsic value indicates a strong conviction in RILs future course of performance. Sources said total market capitalisation of the Reliance REs was Rs 8,960 crore, which is the total value the REs have created for RILs shareholders.

"The automotive industry operates in a constantly evolving environment that is governed by increasingly stringent regulations, shifting mobility trends and a growing demand for more customised vehicles. Automakers are adapting to these changes by building a complex network of production solutions that are both complex, involving many ancillary facilities across the world; and flexible, so as to quickly respond to new demands and challenges. This complexity in manufacturing has increased the need for automakers to find new ways to rein in costs and achieve consistency through precise engineering and rapid quality inspection. The rationale is simple. The ability to manufacture consistently high-quality products has a direct bearing on everything from the costs incurred during manufacturing to the time taken for a company to successfully bring its product to the market. In order to achieve this, ABB has developed a robotic 3D vision and metrology (3DVM) system, which is the latest quality inspection solution that provides fast, automated and accurate metrology testing to dramatically speed up production and help manufacturers build more efficient processes, reduce costly rework and lessen scrappage. The system The 3DVM system is an integrated solution that combines an industrial robot mounted with ABBs 3D optical scanner that inspects quality based on geometrical measurements. The system is capable of detecting defects less than half the width of a human hair, and those that are imperceptible to the naked eye. This eliminates the need for time consuming manual inspections, while also significantly reducing the likelihood of faults and errors, said Toni Roda, ABBs Global Product Manager for Vision. The 3DVM system can be used on both off-line and in-line testing stations and uses a single 3D camera, which eliminates the possibility of views overlapping while reducing hardware failures. The system is immune to vibrations and variations in ambient conditions due to its photogrammetric self-compensation and can detect anomalies at 20 microns. Adjustable light power provides accurate results regardless of light conditions, while the system can also differentiate between shiny and black surfaces without the need for spray. ABB also offers a complete 3D robot inspection cell made up of a robot and a rotating table on which the manufactured part is placed, either manually or with the help of another robot. The scanning robot and the table move in a coordinated manner for the robot to capture images from multiple angles in real-time. The contact-less inspection enables the same system to inspect everything from the fuel tank to the fender skirt and even completely assembled car bodies. All that needs to be changed is for the robot to adjust the reach of its arm. How it works The 3DVM system uses structured light technology and the principles of photogrammetry to capture images of the manufactured product. The optoprojector is fitted on the robotic arm, which moves around the product projecting light to capture images from multiple angles, while the optical scanner scans the product and generates, a detailed, virtual three-dimensional model of the part for inspection in real-time. The movement of the robots arm is automatically programmed on Sidio planner, a plug-in on ABBs offline programming software, RobotStudio. ABB has simplified robot programming by enabling operators to easily instruct the robot on what points of the part that need to be checked. The system calculates the best path for the robots arm and executes the movement. >> ABB online magazine: Digital robotics solutions for the automotive industry Once the 3D model is projected on the screen, the software compares it to a master file and automatically highlights areas where the manufactured part deviates from the master file beyond the threshold set by the operator. The 3D model of the part can be rotated completely for the operator to check for anomalies, allowing manufacturers to take corrective measures without having to disrupt the entire production line. Operators can conduct a series of analysis, for example, test the position and diameter of holes on an automotive part or even define the acceptable levels of spatter on welded parts. The benefits: Speed The 3DVM robot quality inspection system offers a host of advantages over previously use machine and manual inspection methods, of which speed of inspection is a game changer. Traditionally, automotive manufacturers use coordinated-measuring machines (CMM), fitted on a linear axis. The CMMs work by touching the manufactured part at multiple points to generate a digital 3D model. This contact-based measuring technique not only takes nearly eight hours to completely inspect the part, but also offers only a limited number of inspection points. On the other hand, the 3DVM system which projects light patterns and captures images, does not come into contact with the manufactured part, allowing it to complete the inspection within 3-4 minutes. Moreover, the 3D optical scanner is able to capture about 5 million points for inspection, nearly 2 million more than traditional CMM systems. The ability to speed up quality inspection using more information allows companies to avoid unnecessary and costly scrappage and rework of parts. The high-speed inspection allows companies to conduct quality control on many more parts than traditional CMM systems. So in the case of a faulty part, instead of scrapping the entire batch due to the lack of time for further inspection, operators can quickly conduct more checks and reduce the rate of scrappage. Easy automation Unlike traditional metrology processes that are housed in laboratories or built on linear axis at a dedicated spot of the factory floor, the 3D robot quality inspection system by ABB is a modular solution that can be installed in the production area or where quality analysis needs to take place. This reduces the logistics needed to move parts around the factory floor and also cuts down on costs related to building a lab premises. All the programming of the robot can be done offline on RobotStudio and sent to the single logic controller that controls the entire robot inspection setup. This enables the system to work automatically, with minimal or no human intervention for a task that is arduous and repetitive. This feature not only saves time, but also frees up human operators to perform more rewarding work. A touch screen provides an intuitive interface for operations, while employees need only two days of training to handle and control the full operation of the unit. The future of quality inspection The use of the 3D optical scanner automatically digitalises the quality inspection and opens new avenues to further improve the process. The 3DVM system provides comprehensive data recording capabilities, where information is processed in real time using multiprocessor technology. This gives operators quick access to vital records for future auditing purposes. We are now testing the ability for the robot inspection system to harness machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to improve the quality, performance and speed of inspection automatically, said Roda. This will pave way for us to develop quality inspection for different applications beyond the realm of the automotive industry.

"Swiss electric utilities Primeo Energie and Alpiq E-Mobility have opened a pair of highway charging stations in Switzerland that feature battery energy storage and an energy management solution from ABB. Switzerlands Federal Roads Office hopes to install chargers at approximately 100 motorway rest areas over the next few years. Many of these locations have little or no power supply, and as they may be served by different utilities, each can have its own specific cost structures and peak demand charges. ABBs end-to-end solution is designed to help operators manage costs in real time with intelligent energy management. Each of the two new charging sites, which are located on the A2 motorway at the Inseli and Chilchbuehl rest stops, is equipped with an ABB Terra 54 charger, which provides one 50 kW DC fast charging point and one Level 2 charging point, as well as a 350 kW Terra DC fast charger with two additional charging points. ABB says dynamic power sharing between the charging posts will enable them to charge higher-power vehicles such as trucks or buses. ABB also provided a 170 kWh battery energy storage system with power output of 330 kW to help reduce operating costs through peak shaving and to enhance system availability and reliability. Energy management is facilitated by ABBs cloud-based Ability Optimax system. Thanks to the combination of storage and energy management, the local supply network does not have to directly cover the peak load during charging, which significantly reduces costs. ABBs complete solution helps shave peaks in demand and reduces the associated higher tariffs they incur, optimizing operating costs and maximizing return on investment, said ABBs Frank Muehlon. For energy suppliers entering the e-mobility sector, ABB chargers provide all the flexibility, connectivity and features needed to enable such new business models to succeed. Primeo Energie plans to deploy three more similarly-equipped highway charging stations in 2020.

"Taipei, June 26 (CNA) Acer Inc., one of Taiwan's leading PC vendors, which is making efforts to transform itself from a pure PC brand to a ""lifestyle"" brand, has set up a new drinks business division and will put its own energy drink on sale in July.Acer Chairman Jason Chen (???) told reporters earlier this week that Acer is launching its first energy drink, named ""Predator Shot,"" which is an extension of the product line from its gaming PC ""Predator"" series.Chen said the PC market is mature with a lot of competition and that Acer cannot afford to just sit there to wait for any positive change under such circumstances.Instead, Chen said, Acer has to do more, vaulting itself over the business boundary, which is why it is seeking to become a lifestyle brand by selling beverages related to its core PC business.Acer is not the first hardware supplier to produce energy-boosting goods. Last year, Razer Inc. a Colorado-based gaming PC and accessory supplier, brought its ""Respawn"" powdered energy drink mix to the market.Chen cited an internal survey as saying that the targeted clients of energy drinks include gamers who use the beverages to keep their energy levels up when playing.According to Acer, ""Predator Shot"" contains vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B. Chen said gamers also need Lutein to protect their eyes when they spend a long time staring at a PC screen.In addition to the ""Predator Shot,"" Chen said Acer will also launch a collagen drink targeting female gamers.Chen said Acer is scheduled to begin shipping the beverages in July through e-commerce platforms after spending about six months in preparation and securing certifications for the products. ""Predator Shot"" will go on sale in Taiwan and Europe, while the collagen drink will go on sale in Taiwan, Chen said.Chen added that two more drinks are being planned.In 2019, non-PC operations accounted for 15 percent of Acer's total sales, up from 6-7 percent six years ago, the PC brand said.According to Gartner, Acer ranked as the fifth-largest PC supplier in the world in the first quarter of 2020, with a market share of 5.6 percent, behind China's Lenovo Group Ltd.

"Acer has been hosting its own online global press conference, and its announced a raft of updates to its existing lineup of gaming laptops and desktops in a bid to win over the hearts (and wallets) of PC gamers from its rivals Asus and Dell. As expected (because pretty much every laptop maker is now doing this), Acer announced that certain products in its notebook range will now come with the latest 10th Gen Intel Core processors, along with Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2070 Super graphics cards. These are the best laptops of 2020 Our pick of the best desktop PCs How about the best PC games of 2020? The Acer Predator Helios 700, Predator Helios 300, Predator Triton 300 and Nitro 7 will all be getting upgrades. (Image credit: Acer) New Acer Predator Helios 700 The flagship gaming laptop from Acer, the Predator Helios 700, has been upgraded with an aim to offer the kind of performance youd usually expect from the best gaming PCs. It now comes with a choice of an overclockable Intel Core i9-10980HK or i7-10875H and paired with either an RTX 2080 Super or RTX 2070 Super GPU. This laptop, then, is going to be pretty powerful, and will run hot as well  especially with the overclockable CPU, so Acer claims it has overhauled the thermal solution  called Predator PowerGem  with all models using the i9 chip to help keep it cool. It also supportsd up to 64GB of 2,933Hz RAM, and comes with Killer DoubleShot Pro connectivity (Wi-Fi 6 AX1650i wireless and E3100G Ethernet. It also has a 17.3-inch 144Hz G-Sync display as well. The Acer Predator Helios 700 will launch in the US in August and the UK/Australia in September, starting at $2,499.99 (around 2,000, AU$3,600). (Image credit: Acer) Predator Helios 300 The Acer Predator Helios 300 also now comes with 10th gen Intel Core H-series processors, and an overclockable RTX 2070 with Max-Q GPU. It also supports up to 32GB of 2,933 MHz DDR4 RAM and two PCIe NVMe SSDs in RAID 0 configuration. The new version will go on sale in the US in July for $1,199, and in the UK at some point in June for 1,119.99 (around AU$2,200). We expect it to launch in Australia in July. Acer Predator Triton 300 Acers slim and lightweight Triton 300 laptop is also getting an upgrade with 10th gen Intel Core H-series CPUs, and up to Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 with Max-Q design. It now comes with a 240Hz display and up to three M.2 SSDs. The screen also offers 100% sRGB, making it a good call for creatives. Its also got an impressively thin and light build (19.9 mm (0.78 inches) thin and 2.1 kg (4.63 lbs)) for a gaming laptop. This will launch in the US in September, starting at $1,299.99 and in the UK from 1,199.99 (around AU$2,200) in June. (Image credit: Acer) The Acer Nitro 7 also gets a 10th gen Intel upgrade, and now comes with up to an RTX 2060 GPU. Acers extreme performance desktop PC, the Predator Orion 9000 gets an Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition CPU, up to dual Nvidia RTX 2080 TI GPUs in SLI, and better thermal performance thanks to new Predator FrostBlade fans, which Acer claims will provide up to 15% more airflow. Acer also announced the Predator X25 monitor, a 24.5-inch 1080p monitor with a huge 360Hz refresh rates, and supports 99% of the sRGB color gamut. Theres also four new Predator XB3 series monitors: the 31.5-inch Predator XB323QK NV, the 27-inch Predator XB273U GS and Predator XB273U GX, plus the 24.5-inch Predator XB253Q GZ with up to 240Hz refresh rates and up to 4K resolutions. (Image credit: Acer) These monitors also come with RGB LightSense technology, which beams colored light behind the monitor  like the Ambilight feature of Philips monitors. While a lot of the updates to Acers gaming range arent the most revolutionary changes weve seen, they do mean that the companys gaming devices can go toe-to-toe with its competitors. Acer also announced that it will continue to create products to help protect people against Covid-19. Oh, and a Predator Shot energy drink.

"Smart charging infrastructure for Singapore ports automated guided vehicles Case study | Zurich, Switzerland | 2020-06-25 With electric vehicle (EV) numbers growing rapidly, ABB is investing significantly in the development of new battery charging technology and its infrastructure. In a first for ABB, the companys chargers will serve a fleet of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in commercial operation. A desire to counteract poor urban air quality and alleviate global climate change concerns has led to booming EV demand. It is predicted that by 2040, there will be 559 million EVs on the road and 55 percent of all new car sales and 33 percent of the global fleet will be electric. In addition, some analysts anticipate that all new road vehicles will be entirely electric by 2030. It is not only in the personal transport arena that EVs are making an impact: commercial applications are also seeing the benefits of EVs. Apart from their positive environmental aspects, EVs are also very suitable for automated applications, such as those fulfilled by AGVs. AGVs have a range of advantages: no driver is needed so personnel can be redeployed to more productive tasks; performance and costs are predictable; AGVs do not tire and rarely err, therefore suiting the 24/7 operational requirement. Overall safety is improved as AGVs will operate in a more controlled environment and are designed to interface well within the automation environment in which they operate. With so many EV types coming into operation, the rush is on to build charging stations. The installation of this essential infrastructure is one of the next big tasks for the EV industry and must happen faster than EV numbers grow. ABB EV charger infrastructure for PSA Singapore ABB has years of experience in developing, installing, commissioning and maintaining charging infrastructure, including several nationwide charger networks. ABB offers a wide portfolio  from compact AC wall boxes for home charging, through reliable DC fast-charging such as at road-side stations, to innovative on-demand electric-bus and heavy commercial-vehicle charging systems. Connecting chargers using ABB Ability  ABBs unified, cross-industry, digital offering that extends from device to edge to the cloud  enables fast global service, proactive maintenance, control system integration and a host of other benefits. ABBs knowledge and comprehensive product portfolio well-position the company to deploy next-generation EV infrastructure. This experience in EV charging infrastructure underpinned the decision by PSA to choose ABB as a partner in the major expansion of its port facilities. Charging a port When completed in 2040, PSAs Tuas Port in Singapore will feature the world's largest fully automated container terminal. With an annual handling capacity of 65 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit), this future terminal will be a major milestone in Singapores development. The first berth will come into service in 2021 (image 1). Image 1 - PSA container terminal in Singapore Automation will be the essential element in realizing a facility of this size, complexity and sophistication. Operations at the terminal are set to start up in earnest in late 2021 when a fleet of 162 AGVs will begin to come into service progressively. These AGVs  to be phased-in over two years  are set to handle heavy shipping containers. ABB and the Land Systems arm of ST Engineering worked closely together to secure the contract with PSA to deliver and commission integrated smart charging stations for this AGV fleet, to be implemented toward the end of 2020. The contract includes eighteen smart fast charging stations with built-in fault tolerance and self-diagnostic features. Each station is constructed into a fully integrated eHouse on a prefabricated skid with the medium- and low-voltage switchgear, transformer and 450 kW high-power chargers with associated control and monitoring equipment. The solution demonstrates the benefits of combining EV charging and all supporting electrical infrastructure in a complete e-mobility solution (image 2). Image 2 - ABB e-mobility solution for PSA container port ABBs portfolio of heavy commercial electric vehicle chargers feature plug-in connector and automatic pantograph-up and pantograph-down connection options to provide charging to as wide a range of bus, truck and specialist vehicles as possible (image 3). In the Tuas project as pantograph charging would be impeded by the presence of a container on the vehicle and side-access pantographs are unwieldy, specially designed and customized side-access, pin-type connectors from Stäubli are used (image 4). The specification for the pin connector was driven by PSA, working closely with Stäubli to design the connection solution that best suited the application. Combined Charging System (CCS), an open and universal charging protocol based on international standards, was applied for the communication between the electric vehicle and charging infrastructure. PSA fleet management systems will centrally monitor the status of charging stations and AGV battery levels and schedule the AGVs for charging accordingly. Once the AGV has arrived at the designated charging station, it will signal to the charging station to start the charging session. Image 3 - ABB heavy commercial vehicle chargers The ABB equipment communicates with the customers programmable logic controller (PLC) but, unusually, there is no connection to cloud services. At the request of PSA, the system needed to be islanded, which presented the additional challenge of defining a local-site solution for software updates and monitoring. Data is transmitted to the PLC, which then issues commands to the ABB charging infrastructure (start charging, stop charging, fault reset, etc.) and sends status queries. The PLC communicates with the fleet management system for real-time control and management of the charging operations. Operational and diagnostics data are logged at the Remote Fault Diagnostics System and can be used for further analysis and data trending. Image 4 - A custom connector is utilized to facilitate DC fast charging for the AGVs Each charging station comprises three 150 kW AC-to-DC power conversion cabinets. This gives an element of redundancy as, should one cabinet be taken out of service (e.g. for maintenance or because of failure) 300 kW of high-power charging will remain in operation; temporarily having less charging capability is better than temporarily having none at all. Fully charging an AGVs (third-party, 450750V) battery takes around 20 minutes. As stand-alone equipment, the chargers have a standard IP54 enclosure rating, but when installed in the eHouse, protection from the harsh, sea-side environment is further improved. Eighteen 450 kW stations are foreseen plus one, stand alone 150 kW charger cabinet for the customers workshop. ABB is responsible for the design, engineering, construction and commissioning of the entire eHouse, including charging infrastructure and the integration to the AGVs. The containerized implementation simplifies the whole job: the container is dropped on to site where ST Engineering will connect to the main power and where ABB will perform the commissioning. Standardized solutions for grid connection To support the growing demand for EVs and high-power charging, consideration must also be given as to how the power is delivered from the grid to the chargers. Often, investments must be made to increase the capacity of the electrical distribution system, but with the right combination of smart solutions, such as battery storage coupled with an energy management system, these costs can be controlled. ABB has over 100 years of experience in electrical distribution and is a leader in pre-engineered and scalable solutions that facilitate the dynamic growth of sustainable electric mobility. ABBs portfolio includes a wide range of grid connection modules. These modules are designed to fulfill different functionalities and comply with many standards including IEC and ANSI (image 5). In the Tuas megaport project, SF6, gas-insulated medium-voltage switchgear SafePlus is used to fulfill network requirements. Further, the eHouse solution allows the chargers and the other electrical distribution equipment to be installed within the same assembly to minimize site works and makes installation more efficient. The ABB eHouse portfolio provides a modular plug-and-play solution for rapid deployment for e-mobility applications. All of the equipment is pre-tested to seamlessly work together, reducing on-site challenges associated with integrating newer technologies, such as EV charging. Additionally, the modular nature of the design allows PSA to relocate the charging stations to different areas of the terminal port as needed. Image 5 - SafeRing medium-voltage switchgear Leading the charge The PSA Singapore project brings together two of the biggest trends disrupting the mobility industry: the rise of automated guided vehicles and the adoption of EVs. ABBs technology will enable fast charging of the AGVs which is vital for efficient container movement and for increasing the capacity of the port. The pioneering venture from PSA and ST Engineering marks the first time ABBs chargers will be used to power a fleet of automated vehicles for commercial operation. This latest project will further accelerate Singapores transition to a future mobility ecosystem that is safer, cleaner and more accessible. In a wider context, the fast-growing EV market is driving innovative and nimble thinking. ABB plays a leading role in the development of sustainable mobility with new, digital technologies and has participated in many projects around the world. Due to their cost-effectiveness and attractive environmental credentials, electric AGVs will feature in an ever-growing number of commercial operations. The Singapore project provides an ideal template for these applications. References [1] Z.

"Acer is one of the most committed manufacturers when it comes to Chromebooks and routinely releases new and iterated products. Its Chromebook Spin series is among the better known as it combines a 2-in-1 form factor that lets you flip the screen 360 degrees, making it easy to transform a Chromebook into an entertainment device. Today, Acer has announced two new laptops for that lineup: The flagship Chromebook Spin 713 and the entry-level Chromebook Spin 311. Chromebook Spin 713 You wouldn't be wrong if you'd say the Spin 13 successor, the Spin 713, was Acer's latest Chromebook flagship. Being part of Intel's Project Athena, it packs a variety of 10th-gen Intel Core CPUs, ranging from the Pentium Gold 6450U to the i7-10610U. Depending on which version you choose, you have a broad selection of RAM options to look at: 4, 8, or 16GB. You get either 64 or 128GB of eMMC storage, and there's an SSD option with 128 or 256GB. All of these variants come with a 13.5-inch 2K IPS gorilla glass touchscreen (2256 x 1504) featuring the signature 360-degree hinge. The 3:2 aspect ratio should make it perfect for web content, though we don't know if it will get bright enough for outdoor usage just yet. Regarding connectivity, you can expect Wi-Fi 6 support and Bluetooth 5.0. The battery is rated for up to 10 hours, though as always, it depends on how you use the device. The Spin 713 will be available in the US from July starting at $629.99, which will give you the an i5-10210U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD  that's a lot of bang for the buck. There is also an enterprise version with an entry price of $1099, available from August. Chromebook Spin 311 Next up, Acer has announced the Spin 311, the successor of the Spin 11. It's an entry-level 11.6-inch Chromebook meant to handle ""schoolwork and everyday projects."" The 16:9 touchscreen has a resolution of 1366 x 768 and  you guessed it  features a 360-degree hinge, giving it a comfortable tablet form factor when the keyboard is not needed. The laptop is powered by a Mediatek MT8183 processor and 4GB of RAM. You get 32 or 64GB of eMMC storage and can expect up to 15 hours of battery life, thanks to the ARM architecture's efficiency. The Spin 311 supports 302.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. The Chromebook will be released in July starting at $259.99, which makes it a lot more competitive than its predecessor from the get-go. It might prove to be a great Android tablet replacement, though be aware that a Mediatek processor and 4GB of RAM won't get you too far.

Meanwhile, Acer also has a couple of new desktops on offer. Through each, the company has gone all in on Intel's latest processors and NVIDIA graphics. Here's a look at what's new. Predator Helios 700 specs and features Source: Acer Sitting at the top of the pack with Acer's gaming laptops is the Predator Helios 700. Like all of the other refreshes, Acer has embraced Intel's 10th Gen H-Series Core processors and NVIDIA RTX SUPER graphics. Where the company has really pushed things, however, is with thermals. The Predator Helios 700 includes Acer's new ""Predator PowerGem"" thermal solution in models with a Core i9 processor. Acer claims PowerGem has 3.83 times more vertical heat conductivity than copper, which should help move heat more efficiently. Every model also includes three copper heat pipes, a vapor chamber, and AeroBlade 3D fans.

Predator Helios 300 specs and features Source: Acer The Predator Helios 300 sits below the 700, aiming to give you good bang for your buck. That includes RTX 2070 graphics with Max-Q design that can be overclocked, along with a 240Hz display. Acer is also touting the Helios 300's DTS:X Ultra Audio here with its 360-degree sound capabilities. There's also a big focus on cooling with Acer's AeroBlade 3D fans and CoolBoost, which lets you manually adjust fans to bring cooling to ""critical areas"" during intense gaming sessions.

Triton 300 specs and features Source: Acer Going down the lineup is the Triton 300, which also bring 10th Gen Intel Core H-series processors to the table. Like the Helios 300, you can also snag NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Max-Q graphics and a 240Hz display. Cooling is a focus here as well, with a setup similar to the Helios 300.

"Acers Swift 5 appears to be the first laptop containing Intels expected Tiger Lake microprocessors, which is in turn Intels first chip to bring its Xe graphics to PCs. Acer didnt formally identify the Swift 3s microprocessor as Tiger Lake, though referring to it as being powered by the next-gen Intel Core processors with powerful integrated graphics based on Intels new Xe architecture is a tipoffIntel announced Tiger Lake last year, in conjunction with the Xe graphics technology. Acer announced the new Swift 5 at its next@acer event Tuesday morning, which was livestreamed due to COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions. The company didnt reveal many details about the new ultralight laptop, though it will be available in North America for $999. Acer Acers latest Swift 5. When Acer says ultralight, believe it. The Acer Swift 5 (SF514-54T-76PY) we reviewed earlier this year weighed in at 2.18 pounds. Acer said its new Swift 5 (SF514-5) should weigh less than 2.2 pounds. The earlier and new models appear largely identical, with 14-inch IPS displays. Though the performance of the early-2020 Swift 5 suffered a bit, well have to see what the combination of Tiger Lake and an optional Nvidia next-gen GeForce MX350 GPU has in store. The laptop will not include a discrete Xe GPU, though thats still expected in 2020. Intel has said previously that its first entry into the discrete GPU graphics market should take place this year, though the marketing guru behind the effort, Chris Hook, jumped ship at the end of 2019. Acer Swift 5 specs and features Normally, we wouldnt expect many chassis design revisions between generations. This time is different: The latest Acer Swift 5 includes a new hinge that slightly elevates and angles the keyboard, providing a more ergonomic typing experience and better thermal performance. Acer says buyers will also have the option to specify an antimicrobial coating on all exposed surfaces save for the screen, helping to reassure users concerned about the coronavirus or other germs. (The display is coated with a special antimicrobial Gorilla Glass coating, too.) Youll have color choices of Mist Green or Safari Gold, with gold accents. Acer A side profile of the new Acer Swift 5 shows how the keyboard is slightly elevated when the lid is open. Acer doesnt specify what resolution the display will include, though wed suspect 1080p based upon previous models of the Swift 5. The screen is rated for 300 nits, just above what we consider adequate for everyday use, with a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio and a 72% NTSC coverage. Inside, Acer has included what we suspect to be the Tiger Lake processor and the GeForce MX350, though Acers not listing the exact specifications at this time. The company did confirm, however, that theres up to 16GB LPDDR inside, plus PCIe SSD storage options up to 1TB. Three thermal modes (silent, normal and performance) will be supported. And yes, there are two battery options: a 40Wh and a 56Wh, which adds a bit of weight.

"Several models form the Acer Chromebook Spin family, and the company is looking to expand the series a bit with two new machines. The Chromebook 713 and Chromebook 311 tackle widely divergent use-cases and have equally divergent price points. Where the 713, with Project Athena cred, targets business users, the 311 is meant more for home or educational use. Heres the skinny on these two Chromebooks. 2K is more than okay The Chromebook Spin 713 is a bit of a beast. Starting with the screen, its got a 13.5-inch IPS LCD panel with 2,256 by 1,504 pixels. This is a step up from the Full HD displays of most Chromebooks. The screen supports touch input and is protected by Gorilla Glass for scratch resistance. Acer kept the bezels around the 3:2 display to a minimum. The aluminum chassis is tough as nails. It meets MIL-STD-810G, which means it can handle abuse such as drops, banks, knocks, and more. It can withstand drops from up to 48 inches, as well as downward force of 132 pounds. The aluminum resists dents and corrosion. As the name implies, the Chromebook Spin 713 is a convertible. The display swings 360 degrees so the Chromebook may be used as a laptop, in tent mode for watching movies, or slate mode for tablet-style input. It has a backlit keyboard, Gorilla Glass trackpad, and stereo speakers have been integrated underneath the deck. Looking at specs, youve got a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor inside with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and Intel UHD Graphics 620. It has two USB-C ports (USB 3.2 Gen 1), one USB-A port, a microSD card reader, headphone jack, and HDMI port. Wi-Fi 6 future proofs the machine when it comes to connectivity. The lithium-ion battery is rated at 10 hours. It measures 16.8mm thick and wights 1.37kg (3.02lbs). The Chromebook Spin 713 will be available in other configurations. Last, the device meets Intels Project Athena criteria for performance. The device will come in two major models, one at $629.99 (July) and an enterprise edition at $1,099 (August). The enterprise edition features fortified software and top specs. See also: The best Acer Chromebooks Dialing it down to 11 Not looking to spend as much, or want something smaller? You may be interested in the Acer Chromebook Spin 311. This machine targets home and education users who need something simpler. The 311 has an 11.6-inch IPS LCD with Gorilla Glass and HD resolution. It, too, is a convertible, so the display swings all the way around the chassis for multiple form factors. It has an improved keyboard with concave keys and lots of travel. On the spec front, this machine is powered by a Mediatek MT8183 processor. Details regarding RAM, storage, and graphics were not made available. The Spin 311 has Bluetooth 4.2, dual-band Wi-Fi, and weights in at 1kg (2.2lbs). The battery is rates for 15 hours. Youll find two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a headphone jack along the side edges. The Acer Chromebook 311 reaches North America in July for $259.99. More details will be available closer to launch. See also: The best Chromebooks Acer had more than Chromebooks on deck today. It announced a slew of gaming machines. First up are two new Predator machines, the Helios 700 and the Helios 300. The 700 is a gaming notebook that features Acers sliding HyperDrift keyboard. It boasts an overclocked 10th Gen Intel Core i9 or i7 processor, with Nvidia graphics and advanced thermal management. It reaches North America in August for $2,399.99. The Helios 300 relies on 10th Gen Intel Core H processors, Nvidia graphics, and has a 15.6-inch screen. It reaches the market in July for $1,199.99. Acer is for the first time bringing its Predator Triton 300 series to North America. This notebook has a 10th Gen Intel Core H processor, Nvidia graphics, 240Hz display and heat pipes. It arrives in September for $1,299.99. Last, Acer updated the Nitro 7 with a sleek metal chassis. This 5.5-pound beats has the same 10th Gen Intel Core H processors and Nvidia graphics on the Triton, 15.6-inch screen, 144Hz refresh rate with 3ms response time, and blur-free gameplay. It arrives in October for $999.99. Next: The best Chromebooks under $300

"Acers Nitro 7 has long been the middle child Jan Brady in the companys gaming laptop family, sandwiched between the bulkier, but lower-cost Nitro 5 and the more luxurious Predator Triton 500-series. The latest Nitro 7 is finally stepping out. Acer gave us a chance to go hands-on ahead of the laptop's announcement Tuesday at the company's next@acer virtual event. The biggest change to the latest Nitro 7 is the top GPU. The previous iteration stopped at Nvidias GeForce GTX 1660 Ti. Thats a very decent GPU and great for gaming, but it lacks a key feature: hardware ray tracing support. The newest Nitro 7 gets a GeForce RTX 2060 with 8GB of GDDR6. As part of our preview, were not allowed to disclose benchmarks of this pre-production unit, but on paper, we can say it should perform very decently. Gordon Mah Ung The Nitro 7 features a four-zone keyboard with 10-key number pad. The GPUs base clock is 1,005MHz, and its boost clock is 1,350MHz. Those numbers dont really mean much though, as the dynamic boosting will see far higher clock speeds depending on the workload, power, and cooling of the laptop. The GPUs memory uses a crop of low-voltage GDDR6 memory, which Nvidia has introduced with its latest GPUs and which is rated at 1,353MHz on our unit. While we cant comment on performance of this pre-production Nitro 7, we figure itll be very competitive with some of the original GeForce RTX 2060 laptops weve seen. Also new is is a move from a 6-core 9th-gen Core i7-9750H to 6-core 10th-gen Core i7-10750H. Thats less of a mover for most gaming laptops, but most of the 10th-gen CPUs weve seen do offer decent bumps in performance. Gordon Mah Ung The Nitro 7's right side features USB-C, USB-A, and HDMI. Whats unexpected is how this particular Nitro 7 was configured. While the top Nitro 7 we could find previously featured a 512GB SSD with a 1TB hard drive, this Nitro 7 comes with two Western Digital SN530 M.2 SSDs in RAID 0. We werent allowed to open the unit up, but if its built on the same chassis as the previous model, it likely has a bay for 2.5-inch drives. Were making that guess because the battery capacity is about the same at 58 Watt-hours. Thats a fairly small battery for a gaming laptop, but Acer uses that space for that 2.5-inch drive bay. So good for storage, but probably meh for battery life. Our unit also came outfitted with 32GB of RAM, which is more of a premium feature. If its similar to the previous model, both modules should be easy to get to once youve taken off the bottom. Most of the rest of the Nitro 7 appears to be based on the previous version, with a slender profile (less than 20mm thick and 144Hz 1080p screen. Pricing of the newest Nitro 7 starts at $1,000, but we suspect that wont be with the 2TB of storage and 32GB of RAM. Gordon Mah Ung The left side of the Nitro 7 has two USB-A, Gigabit ethernet, and a headset jack. The power is tucked in back.

The refreshed Acer Swift 5 is expected to launch in October starting at $1,000. Acer took the wraps off of a load of new PCs today, and not least among them is the new Swift 5. Expected to launch in October startin at $1,000, the new Swift 5 carries forward the elegant look of its predecessor, but with new hardware inside. There's also a new color to look forward to: mist green with gold accents. Acer Swift 5 features and specs Source: Acer The new Acer Swift 5 runs on Windows 10 home, powered by up to 16GB of RAM and Intel's Core i-series processors. Acer is mum at the moment on exactly which processors the Swift 5 will run, but it says the integrated graphics are based on Intel's new Xe architecture. Alternatively, you'll be able to get NVIDIA GeForce MX350 discrete graphics if you prefer. The focus here, however, is on portability. Acer has backed that up with a thin and light design measuring a little over half-an-inch thick. That's packed in an all-metal chassis that looks rather slick. The 14-inch screen is flanked by slim bezels, and there's a layer of antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass to help cut down on screen crud.

"The Acer Swift 3 (SF314-42) sticks to the tried and tested. This 14-inch thin-and-light notebook does not have standout features or a unique design. What it does offer is excellent value, thanks to a judicious selection of practical features (Wi-Fi 6, USB-C charging and a fingerprint sensor) and a surprisingly powerful AMD processor that blows away its more expensive Intel competitor. The Swift 3 uses AMDs latest Ryzen 5 4500U chip, which is a mid-tier six-core processor that slots in between the Ryzen 3 and Ryzen 7 chips. On paper, one would expect the Ryzen 5 to compete with Intels Core i5 processors. But to my surprise, the Ryzen 5 actually beats the latest Intel Core i7-1065G7 in the PCMark 10 benchmark, which tests a variety of common computing workloads. The Swift 3 scored 4,776 in PCMark 10 compared to 4,556 for the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5i, which is powered by Intels Core i7-1065G7. The Swift 3 performed significantly better than the Lenovo notebook in PCMark 10s Digital Content Creation segment, which involves photo and video editing. The Radeon graphics in the Swift 3 are also impressive for an integrated graphics solution. In the 3DMark Time Spy test, it scored 1,067, which is not too far off from the 1,353 score of the Lenovo, which has a dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX350 chip. This means the Swift 3 will run most video games as long as you choose the lower graphics settings or switch to a lower resolution. More importantly, the Swift 3 is fairly quiet even during more intensive workloads. The bottom of the laptop can become a tad warm, but remains comfortable to touch. The Swift 3 has a similar unassuming silver metallic chassis as the 13.5-inch Swift 3 that I tested earlier this year. It weighs a handy 1.2kg and the build quality is decent. With an HDMI port, two USB Type-A ports and a USB Type-C port, the Swift 3 has most of the ports required by the average user. My only nitpick is the lack of a memory card reader. FOR  Powerful processor  Excellent value for money  Runs cool and quiet AGAINST  Weak speakers  Screen could be brighter SPECS PRICE: $1,198 PROCESSOR: AMD Ryzen 5 4500U (2.3GHz) GRAPHICS: AMD Radeon Graphics RAM: 16GB DDR4 SCREEN SIZE: 14 inches,1,920 x 1,080 pixels CONNECTIVITY: USB 3.2 Type-C Gen 2, USB 3.2 Type-A Gen 1, USB 2.0, HDMI, audio jack BATTERY: 48 watt-hour RATING FEATURES: 4/5 DESIGN: 4/5 PERFORMANCE: 4.5/5 VALUE FOR MONEY: 5/5 BATTERY LIFE: 4.5/5 OVERALL: 4.5/5 While it has a standard barrel power connector, its USB-C port can also be used to recharge the laptop. This is convenient as I can use a single USB-C charger for both the laptop and my smartphone instead of having two different ones. Unlike the 13.5-inch Swift 3, which has a 3:2 aspect ratio, the 14-inch variant has a conventional 16:9 aspect ratio that is more suited for watching videos. Unfortunately, the movie-viewing experience is hampered by the laptops weak speakers, which sound tinny even at maximum volume. I recommend using headphones instead. The matt display, too, is not as bright as I would have liked. You probably have to increase the brightness to a level close to the maximum in a well-lit room. Viewing angles are good, though the colours are not vibrant enough. The Swift 3 has good battery life, clocking 6 hours and 45 minutes in The Straits Times video-loop battery test with its display set to the maximum brightness. At $1,198, the Swift 3 offers incredible value for its price. The attractive price tag also makes its few flaws seem less insurmountable  this is currently the budget laptop to beat.

"Acers Swift 5 laptop is getting a major upgrade when it gets refreshed this fall. Though Acer was coy about mentioning Intels 11th Gen processors by name, the Swift 5 SF14-55 could be one of the first Ultrabooks to ship with Intels next-generation CPU. Acer stated that the Swift 5 will be arriving with next-generation Intel processors alongside Intel Xe integrated graphics and optional Nvidia MX350 discrete GPU. Intels Xe graphics, which will succeed the companys current Gen 11 integrated graphics architecture, is widely believed to launch as part of its 11th Gen processor lineup and the underlying architecture is what Intel will be using on its own line of discrete graphics cards. Xe graphics is expected to provide a 100% uplift in graphics performance over Gen 11 graphics, and this could help Intel better compete with AMDs Ryzen 4000 mobile processors, which are gaining popularity. Of note, Acer also has a Swift 3 laptop with AMDs Ryzen 4000 onboard, so it will be interesting to see how the two models perform. The Swift 5 can be configured with up to 1 TB solid-state drive and 16GB LPDDRAX memory. Acer is also bringing cooling controls to the laptop, so you can now tune the fans to silent, normal, or performance modes based on your task or environment. Like the model that it will replace, the new Swift 5 will come with a 14-inch FHD display, but Acer is making this laptop even more compact by reducing the bezels surrounding the screen. The effect is that this notebook will sport a 90% screen-to-body ratio. The screen can reach up to 300 nits of brightness and supports 72% of the NTSC color space, Acer claimed. Another potentially useful feature  and a very timely one given the state of the current global health pandemic  is that this laptop comes with an antimicrobial coating on the Corning Gorilla Glass screen. In addition to Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, Acer also includes some of its own tuning to the mix. Voice tracking, adaptive beamforming, voice recognition enhancements, and clearer conference call optimizations help to complement the built-in far-field microphones. Acers True Harmony audio tuning along with DTS Audio tuning will help with content consumption. The whole packages weighs just under 1kg, and the laptop has a chassis made from magnesium alloy for durability. The Swift 5 will be available in either mist green or safari gold hues. Pricing for the laptop starts at $999 when it launches in October, and the company will offer different configurations of the Swift 5. Editors' Recommendations

"ALBANY  A top White House official fired back at Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday, tweeting that the Democrat alone is to blame for New Yorks slow coronavirus shutdown, and the massive death toll in nursing homes related to the virus. My statement regarding Governor Cuomos ridiculous comments attempting to shift blame and erase his direct responsibility for so many precious lives lost in New York, Hogan Gidley, the deputy assistant and principal deputy press secretary to President Trump, quote-tweeted ahead of a screenshot of his actual statement Tuesday morning. Governor Cuomo alone is to Blame for refusing to sit down New York and forcing seniors who tested positive for Coronavirus back into his states nursing homes. His reckless response did not follow CMS and CDC guidelines devastating the senior population  and no amount of revisionist history can erase Governor Cuomos grossly incompetent decision or the fact that President Trumps bold, aggressive actions saved millions of lives, he wrote. Cuomo appeared in two television interviews ahead of the criticism, where he defended his own controversial order  and that of the New York state Health Department  issued on March 25 that barred nursing homes from denying admittance to coronavirus-positive patients following their hospital discharge. No, it wasnt a mistake because  you didnt want to leave a senior citizen in the hospital for two weeks if you didnt need to be in a hospital bed for two weeks, the third-term Democrat said on MSNBC. He also blamed the virus rapid spread on facility staffers who tested positive for the disease, but were permitted to work under state guidance because they were asymptomatic. Cuomo continued to defend the order, arguing the directive issued was aligned with federal guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from March 16 and that the federal government is instead blameworthy. New Yorks 6,250 nursing home deaths as of Monday have risen to a national issue, with congressional Republicans seeking data and in-person testimony from Cuomo on the topic. That request came last week to Cuomo and four other Democratic governors whose nursing home policies have also fallen under scrutiny by Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, along with the committees other GOP members. New York is the only state that has not responded to the panels request, with the other four states  California, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania  answering individually, in letter form last week. I know history shows that if you dont bend to the presidents will, youll get fired, but enough with the lies, Cuomo senior adviser Rich Azzopardi responded to Gidley in a statement, citing a section of state law that says nursing homes should only accept residents if the homes can provide adequate care  a section of law the governor has used in the past to defend his order. Thats always been operative in NY, and is consistent with every federal guideline issued  all of which are still in effect  and the fact it took these toadies months to say anything shows how disingenuous this all is, he continued. More than a dozen other states adopted the same policies off the same federal guidelines  and yet the Washington Republicans are hell-bent on politically targeting five Democratic states in an election year for them. The bottom line is that federal response to this pandemic has been a complete disaster, everyone knows it and no ones dumb enough to fall for this diversion.

"World No. 5-ranked PC vendor Acer will start selling a new Google Chromebook model with an advanced processor and hardware tough enough for military use, its latest in a series of products that have historically been strong-sellers. The Taiwanese company said late Tuesday it had launched its Chromebook Spin 713 with an Intel processor that offers advanced mobile performance and up to 10 hours of battery life. The thin, convertible laptop that runs on Chrome like all PCs in its class will come with a 13.5-inch touch display and military-grade durability to resist shocks and dents, Acer said in a statement. Spin 713 will sell in Europe this month and reach North America in August. The new model will be priced at $630, which is more than three times that of earlier models. These Chromebooks will appeal to advanced students and entry-level office workers who want stronger performance in a small, light PC, says Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research in Taiwan. But the price will limit overall sales, he forecasts. High-end Chromebooks have never sold that well, Wang says. I dont think this one device will help Acer that much. The price is up in the normal range for PCs and costs are probably not low, but sales wont be high, though a lot comes down to branding. Chromebooks have been a bright spot for Acer over the past decade and helped it out of a troubled time between 2011 and 2013. The company joined Google in 2011 as one of the worlds first PC vendors to sell Chromebooks, which are normally aimed the public school market. In 2017, Acer had the worlds largest market share for Chromebooks , topping Fujitsu and Lenovo. Acer acknowledged in a statement double-digit growth in revenue from Chromebooks in the second quarter of 2018. Sales across vendors totaled about 10.1 million units last year, according to Statista, up from 8.9 million the previous year. Chromebooks helped Acer grow revenues in March this year as users worldwide relied more on PCs to work from home and avoid the coronavirus pandemic, industry analysts said at the time . The new Spin 713s processor comes from an Intel innovation program aimed at improving laptops, Acer said in the statement Tuesday. It should allow premium productivity for business professionals, an Intel official was quoted saying in the statement. Acer ranked fifth in global shipments in the first quarter this year behind Lenovo, HP, Dell and Apple, market research firm Gartner data show .

"(Credit: Acer) Acer is previewing an update to an existing Windows laptop thats expected to debut with Intels new Tiger Lake processors and Xe graphics technology. On Tuesday, Acer announced the companys refresh to the Swift 5, a 14-inch notebook thats designed to be thin and light. Expect it to launch in October, starting at $999. The Swift 5 is slated to arrive with Intels next gen processor, the PC maker said, a likely nod to the Tiger Lake family of mobile CPUs. The same laptop will also feature, in some models, Intels new Xe graphics architecture deployed in graphics silicon as part of the CPU. Xe is designed to compete, in coming integrated-graphics and dedicated-chip flavors, with GPU solutions from Nvidia GeForce family and AMDs Radeon group. (Credit: Acer) However, the Xe architecture wont arrive as the basis of a discrete graphics chip inside this laptop. Instead, the technology backs the graphics silicon that is integrated into the next-generation processor, according to Acer. This Xe-based graphics will be the successor to the ""Gen 11"" Iris Plus and UHD Graphics solutions integrated into Intel's ""Ice Lake"" 10th Generation mobile processors. Taking Tiger Lake by Strategy Last week, Intel gave a taste of what we can expect from a Tiger Lake setup like this one. On Twitter, the company demoed a prototype laptop with Tiger Lake and the integrated Xe architecture running the game Battlefield V at 1080p on high graphics settings. The clip shows the game, which was published in 2018, running fairly smoothly at 30 frames per second, despite the laptop having no dedicated GPU. Still, consumers who want a bigger graphical boost will be able to buy the Swift 5 with an optional Nvidia GeForce MX350 dedicated chip, which will presumably be a step up from the Xe silicon on the Swift 5's processor. As for Tiger Lake, Intel is promising the chips will offer a double-digit performance gain, thanks to the companys 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. The Tiger Lake processors and its motherboards have also been designed to be smaller, enabling PC makers to create thinner and lighter laptops. To improve the Swift 5, Acer has managed to minimize the bezels around the 14-inch screen even more. The product now has a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio, an increase from the 86.4 percent ratio of last years Swift 5 model. The laptop also comes with a touch display that features Corning's antimicrobial coating to help keep germs at bay. Additionally, users have the option to further include an antimicrobial coating on the touchpad, keyboard, and all covers of the device, Acer noted in its initial release. (Credit: Acer) Another change is to the products hinge, which will slightly elevate the rear of the laptop when fully opened, allowing for a more ergonomic typing experience, and better cooling, according to the company. The laptop still weighs in at 2.2 pounds and retains its metallic chassis. Buyers can outfit it with up to 1TB of SSD-based storage, and up to 16GB of RAM. Other key perks include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, two built-in stereo speakers, and a USB Type-C/Thunderbolt 3 port. Further Reading Laptop Reviews
