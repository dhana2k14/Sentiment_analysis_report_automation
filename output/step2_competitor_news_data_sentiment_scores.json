{"_news_text": "\"ABB Power Grids supports China to build multi-terminal power transmission projects Press releases | Beijing, China | 2020-06-16 Partnering with China Southern Power Grid to deliver clean power from west to east China On June 11, the Yunnan-Guizhou \u00b1500 kilovolt (kV) direct current (DC) transmission line was officially put into operation. As the world\u0092s first \u00b1500 kV three-terminal power project developed by China Southern Power Grid (CSG) in south China, the line will effectively increase the hydropower consumption in Yunnan Province, southwest China and deliver more clean electricity to Guangdong Province in southeast China. ABB Power Grids provided leading high-voltage (HV) technologies for the newly constructed Luquan converter station in Yunnan Province to ensure safe and reliable power supply. The Yunnan-Guizhou transmission line is China\u0092s first \u0093three-terminal\u0094 DC power project that transformed from a \u0093two-terminal\u0094 DC transmission line. It added a converter station in Luquan, Yunnan, connected with the established Guizhou-Guangdong DC transmission line and achieved the three-terminal DC transmission link across Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangdong provinces. It is expected to transmit around 6 billion kWh of hydropower every year and reduce coal consumption by 1.8 million tons and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions by about 4.8 million tons. Although facing the challenging schedule, ABB Power Grids supplied 500 kV gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) and gas-insulated line (GIL) to the project in 5 months, and overcame the situation of COVID-19, successfully completing the on-site installation and commission. As a market and technology leader in GIS technology, ABB Power Grids offers ratings and applications from 72.5 kV to 1,200 kV and has a global installed base of almost 37,000 bays. GIS is a compact metal encapsulated switchgear that uses pressurized insulating gas and enables safe operations in confined spaces while significantly reducing equipment footprint. As a key equipment in HVDC projects, GIS will largely improve the safety and reliability of the power network. Meanwhile, ABB Power Grids also contributed to the construction of the Kunliulong \u00b1800 kV DC power project, another transmission line owned by CSG to transfer power from southwest to southeast China. The company provided key technologies, including GIS, DC dry capacitor, semiconductor and high-speed switches. ABB Power Grids\u0092 technology will ensure reliable and efficient clean energy transmission with optimal power quality and minimal losses from Yunnan Wudongde Hydropower Station to Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and Guangxi Province. The 1452-kilometer Kunliulong project is the world\u0092s first ultra-high-voltage (UHV) multiple terminal DC project to adopt VSC-HVDC (high voltage direct current) technology, reaching 8 million kilowatts (kW) capacity. It will pass across Kunming, Guizhou, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in south China and reduce coal consumption by 10 million tons and CO 2 emissions by 26.6 million tons each year in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, effectively enhancing energy conservation and air pollution prevention. \u0093The two major power projects developed by CSG are essential to promote the consumption of clean energy and coordinate regional development. Although facing the great challenges amid the epidemic, we worked closely with our customers and strongly supported the project to operate as scheduled,\u0094 said Zhang Jinquan, Senior Vice President of ABB Group and Head of Greater China Region. \u0093Our leading technology will continue to help China deliver clean electricity power across regions and speed up China\u0092s energy transformation and high-quality economic development.\u0094 As a leading power technology provider, ABB Power Grids pioneered, both the commercial HVDC and GIS technologies over 50 years ago. In China, ABB has participated around 40 HVDC power projects by far, including multiple HVDC transmission lines built by CSG, such as the \u00b1800kV Nuozhadu-Guangdong and Dianxibei-Guangdong UHVDC power projects. ABB Power Grids is a global leader and pioneer in power technologies. We create value for customers across the energy, industrial, transportation and infrastructure sectors, delivering an extensive range of digitally-advanced solutions.

ABB B&R Flexible Production Lines Optimization Design Contest As personalization has increasingly conquered the consumer market, manufacturers and factories have to meet \u0093diverse goods in smaller batches\u0094 demands, even \u00931-piece batch\u0094 needs, by deploying intelligent production lines. How to quickly construct such production lines has become the key to success in this competition. The ACOPOStrak, B&R's track-based transport systems let you move products through your production line more efficiently while simultaneously improving quality. This new technology from B&R features independent shuttles moved by permanent magnets along a long-stator linear motor track. Product movements can be configured individually, including variable speed and acceleration as well as batch grouping and ungrouping. The dramatic increase in processing speed makes your line more productive. The B&R contest on optimization design of Flexible production line and 2020 B&R Scholastic Union Competition will be based on ACOPOStrak flexible transport technology and leverage the digital simulations to enable players to exercise their abilities to plan and design production lines used in intelligent manufacturing. This year's contest will cover full-time universities and colleges and members of the B&R Scholastic Union. Founded in 2006, B&R Scholastic Union is dedicated to inspiring college students\u0092 innovative thinking and abilities to apply theories to practice and motivating them to analyze and solve problems relating to real needs in the industrial automation control processes.

As an excellent partner of the summit, ABB attended the event with a full series of Smart City solutions. James Zhao, lead business manager for ABB Electrification in China delivered a keynote speech in WAIC- Intelligent Trending Forum, sharing the industry with ABB's leading technologies and achievements in smart cities and long-term vision for a sustainable future. With the theme of \"\"Intelligent World, Indivisible Community\"\", the 2020 WAIC ??attracted scientists and entrepreneurs worldwide to discuss hot topics related to cutting-edge technologies and industrial trends in the intelligence field. In the future, the global population will continue to grow, and the urbanization process will further accelerate. The United Nations estimates that the global population will reach 9 billion by 2040, and 2/3 of the people will live in cities. It will generate great challenges to the resources, energy supply, transportation and environment in cities. How to acquire and use energy more efficiently, build a green and convenient transportation system, and create more comfortable life for people have become the core issues of building smart cities in the future. With this in mind, ABB always strives to help build safe, comfortable, efficient and sustainable smart cities. James Zhao, lead business manager for ABB Electrification in China, said, \u0093ABB electrical solutions can provide reliable support for various application scenarios such as distribution grids, data centers, buildings, and transport in smart cities, realizing the optimal use of resources and real-time response on the demand and supply side, enhancing the energy utilization, empowering new infrastructure construction, and accelerating the process towards smart cities, with the aid of the Internet of Things (IOT), big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\u0094 Building connected urban distribution grids The power grid is the most critical infrastructure in the city.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB showcases digital technologies at Marintec China 2019 Press release | ?? | 2019-12-03 ABB showcases digital technologies at Marintec China 2019 ABB is showcasing a wide range of solutions for safe, efficient and sustainable ship operations at Marintec China 2019, Asia\u0092s most authoritative B2B platform for the international maritime industry. Electrification, digitalization, and connectivity are changing the way people and goods are moved across the seas. As a leading shipbuilding country, China is shaping up its position as one of the key global stakeholders in the digital transformation of the marine industry, driven by the increasing demand for efficient and sustainable operations. With its leading-edge technologies, vast experience and localized services, ABB is well positioned to support the transformation of China's marine industry. ABB\u0092s innovative products and solutions including ABB AbilityTM Marine Pilot product family, electric propulsion system, digital turbocharging solution, energy storage system, Collaborative Operations Center, smart motors and drives, and smart power distribution products are among the highlights, in a bid to help ship owners and operators achieve higher level of performance, profitability, sustainability, safety and reliability. The Azipod\u00ae electric propulsion system, ABB's star product in the marine field, was showcased at this event. A gearless steerable electric podded propulsion system, Azipod suspends its electric motor in an underwater pod outside the hull, which can increase fuel efficiency by 20% and significantly improve the maneuverability of the ship while eliminating the need for complex gear drives. Historically its use has been on icegoing vessels and cruise ships, the value of Azipod propulsion has been seen in expedition vessels, ferries, offshore living platforms and self unloading bulkers. China's first self-built polar scientific expedition icebreaker \"\"Xuelong 2\"\", the first domestically-made luxury cruise ship and \"\"Science\"\" marine scientific research vessel all adopted the Azipod\u00ae electric propulsion system. Also on display is the Marine Pilotfamily of ship handling tools, including situational awareness and advanced vessel control. Marine Pilot Vision utilizes sensor fusion and computer vision technology to realize real-time visualization and awareness of the ship's environment. The system assists ship\u0092s crews to predict the ship's navigation status and avoid potential risks. This in turn is with the ultimate view to improve navigational safety and operation efficiency. Meanwhile, Marine Pilot Control makes use of advanced algorithms to rethink what is possible in controlling a ship with today\u0092s technology. With its touch screen interface, a ship\u0092s officer is able to navigate a vessel over its entire operation profile efficiently whether or not the ship is DP classed. Thanks to these systems, the \"\"Suomenlinna 2\"\" ice classed passenger ferry successfully completed the historic remote control trial in Finland in late 2018. The system will also be deployed in Singapore during 2020 to develop autonomous tugs, giving crews the chance to rest during transits and allowing them to perform at their best during highly demanding ship handling operations. Among the turbocharging offerings on display this time, the upgraded ABB AbilityTM Tekomar XPERT for fleet is particularly eye-catching. As a set of intelligent software for engine performance analysis and diagnosis, it realizes the digital integration of device, systems and the cloud, providing performance evaluation and comprehensive analysis for the engines of the entire fleet to improve the engine efficiency and reduce the fuel costs. Operating according to the resulted analysis and specific recommendations, users can usually save 0.5 to 3 tons of fuel per day for each ship. The solution is currently installed in more than 1,800 ships worldwide. ABB provides comprehensive measurement and analytical products and solutions for marine industry to optimize operation efficiency and lower costs. Many of these products, particularly for the application in ballast water measurement, energy management and emission monitoring, are showcased at the Marintec China 2019. Taking the GAA610-M gas analysis system for an example, it includes a full set of sample probe, heated bundle, sample conditioning system and analyzer which can help ship owners better monitor the gas emission and meet the stricter regulations of IMO on sulfur emissions which will be officially implemented since 2020. The special environment of the marine industry places high demands on ship products. ABB also brought multiple DC grid converters, marine type-approved drives and Liquid-cooled drive modules to the Marintec. Among them, the ACS880 DC grid converter can be used for various new energy vehicles. It has the powerful function of connecting energy storage device to the DC grid, connecting the AC grid to the DC grid and connecting the motor/generator to the DC grid. It is a marine type approved by China Classification Society. ABB smart motors and generators are also widely used in the marine industry. Marine motors such as the new-generation high-performance motors, synchronous generators and smart motors are exhibited. The smart motors combine low-voltage marine motor and ABB AbilityTM smart sensors, which can monitor different operating parameters of the motor in real time, providing customers with better visual management and offering maintenance recommendations through algorithm analysis. It can reduce downtime by 70%, extend motor life by 30% and save energy up to 10%. ABB also showcased a wide range of intelligent power distribution products and solutions including MyRemoteCare asset health management platform, digital LV and MV distribution solutions, ship-to-shore power solution, compact energy management system and solid state circuit breakers. The MNS 3.0 LV digital distribution solution for marine is integrated with intelligent temperature monitoring and Ethernet communication technology.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB India (ABB) reported decent performance in challenging times led by strong focus on execution of OB, cost rationalization initiatives and higher other income. During the quarter Motion division grew by 4% YoY led by conversion of backlog orders in all major segments, while other segments reported de-growth. Order inflow came in at Rs13bn, down 19% YoY owing to uncertainty in the economic environment and delay in decision making cycles. Sectors like electrical distribution, transport, data centers, consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals and food & beverage continue to show healthy growth. Outstanding order remained subdued at Rs44bn providing revenue visibility for few quarters. Management believes that impact of Covid-19 would continue in the short term as pandemic situation is yet to settle-down. Considering the adverse impact of pandemic on the economy and uncertain business conditions we believe maintaining consistent growth in order inflow will remain challenging. We expect gradual recovery as impact of pandemic remains uncertain. In the long run, we believe ABB\u0092s resilient business model, healthy global distribution network, diversified business segment and comfortable balance sheet would benefit the company from recovery, once economic activity starts picking up. The stock is currently trading at 45.7x/41.5x CY21E/CY22E. We maintain Hold rating with TP of Rs880.

{"_news_text": "\"A pure play on Industrial Automation ABB India\u0092s (ABB) CY19 Annual Report provides valuable insights into the Industrial Automation trend picking up in India. Export growth of 55% in CY19, average FCF/PAT conversion of 130% over the past 5 years, steady improvement in RoIC to 21% in CY19, and adj. PAT CAGR of 24-25% over the 3/5 year period (like-for-like adj. for demerger) signifies strong business fundamentals. Key insights highlighted below: * Successful demerger of Power Grid business: The demerger of the Power Grid business in CY19 has led to ABB transforming into a complete product and services business. Projects revenues constituted ~35% of the total revenue before the demerger. Working capital (WC) cycle of the residual business is far superior compared to the earlier entity, which should boost free cash flow generation further. * Strong 55% export growth in CY19: Exports grew 55% YoY and continued its upward trajectory with growth across business segments. Exports (as % of sales) stood at 17.8% in CY19 \u0096 the highest in the last 10 years. Further, inroads were made in Latin America with medium-voltage breakers and the recent innovation of auto re-closers. The Middle East and Africa are strong markets for ABB\u0092s solutions for process industries. The year also witnessed the global success of LV IEV motors, resulting in the highest-ever growth for exports in the Motion segment. * Improving Return ratios, FCF generation best in sector: Superior performance in the core business has led to increase in RoIC to 21% in CY19, up from 11% in CY12. We believe RoIC is a better representation of business quality as high cash on the balance sheet depressed RoE to ~10% in CY19. FCF/PAT conversion stood at 151% v/s past 5-year average of ~130%. ? Lower dependence on traded goods: Gross margin expanded by 100bp YoY to 33.5% in CY19 on account of lower purchase of traded goods with higher sales of in-house manufactured products. With rising share of products manufactured in India, gross margin should remain stable or increase going forward. * Chalking new growth avenues in an otherwise weak capex environment: With the broader capex trends remaining muted, ABB has been able to find growth avenues due to its superior product portfolio, which is used across industries (from process industries to consumption-centric manufacturing entities). Thus, the company is experiencing growth from end markets like data centers, process industries, pharma and food and beverage (F&B). ABB is looking to increase its focus in building an automation segment. Consumer electronics segment is showing strong growth potential too with customers investing in robotic automation for productivity gains. Sectors like Transportation, Steel and Water & Waste Water performed well; however, Cement, Power and Oil & Gas witnessed slowdown. * Digital offerings on the rise: CY19 witnessed rising digital offerings with an aim to enrich customers and channel partners. In Electrification products, focused approach toward digitalization has led to the first order from a leading carbon black manufacturer. In the Motion segment, ABB introduced the cutting-edge, innovative digital powertrain concept in India \u0096 \u0091ABB Ability Condition Monitoring\u0092 \u0096 enabling full transparency on key parameters for drives, motors, mounted bearings and pumps. In the Industrial Automation segment, ABB pioneered the first \u0091Made in India\u0092 digital solution for real-time condition monitoring \u0096 the \u0091Digi Sampler 2.0\u0092 \u0096 to empower customers to comply with regulatory requirements while improving productivity. * CY19 performance highlights: (a) P&L highlights: While revenue grew 9% to INR73.2b, EBITDA growth was stronger at 16% YoY to INR5.3b. EBITDA margin improved to 7.3% (v/s 6.8% in CY18). Adj. PAT grew 38% to INR3.5b as the effective tax rate stood at 31.7% (v/s 35.7% in FY19). (b) B/S highlights: WC cycle improved to 25 days from 40 days in CY18, largely due to the demerger of the higher WC intensive Power Grid business. Net cash position stood at INR16b (~45% of the net worth). (c) Cash flow highlights: FCF generation remained strong and grew 39% YoY to INR5.7b. (d) Return ratios: Overall, RoIC improved marginally to 20.9% (v/s 20.8% in CY18). Continued business RoE (after adj. for assets held for sale), improved to 10.4% from 7.6% in CY18. Note: RoE was depressed due to high cash balance of INR16b (45% of net worth). * Valuation and view: ABB remains a pure play on the long-term Industrial Automation and \u0091Make-in-India\u0092 theme. We maintain our Buy rating with TP of INR1,090, based on unchanged Mar\u009222E target PE multiple of 45x (at par with our target multiple for pure automation businesses and as justified by DCF; as well as ~min 1-year forward PE multiple for ABB over past 10 years). CY19 marked strong growth in services/export revenue, which is our key investment thesis for the longer term.

{"_news_text": "\"An equal world is an enabled world. Individually, we're all responsible for our own thoughts and actions - all day, every day. We can actively choose to challenge stereotypes, fight bias, broaden perceptions, improve situations and celebrate achievements. Collectively, each one of us can help create an equal world where opportunities are not distributed on discriminatory basis rather accept and embrace diverse needs of the new-age workforce.\"\" In this series of #EachForEqual, read thi sexclusive interaction with Raman Kumar Singh, CHRO, ABB India to know how to design and implement a well-rounded, organization-wide inclusion strategy. Q: What are your views on workplace equity and workplace equality? What do you think is more important? At ABB we are clear that workplace equity is a precursor to workplace equality. Creating and driving a gender diverse and inclusive workplace is a constant endeavor which requires daily action. Recognizing this, gender diversity & inclusion goals are part of our people strategy which is to be driven across the organization. Q: How do you make equity at the workplace a leadership agenda? ABB recognizes that a diverse and talented workforce provides the quality and skills required to create competitive advantage. Such diversity promotes both innovation and business success, if allowed to flourish in an atmosphere of inclusiveness. The purpose of the Diversity & Inclusion committee at ABB is not only to enhance diversity for the organization, but also leverage it for gender diverse workforce to achieve superior business results. To support this, our diversity metrics for measuring internal KPI\u0092s are aligned with the Group People Strategy and crucial programs for capability building like the Women Leadership Development Program (RISE) for potential female employees to ensure we encourage and foster the next line of leadership. Q: What are the opportunities for businesses in creating an equitable workplace? How can we change the mindset of people around equity and help them avoid any kind of unconscious bias? Ease of working with someone is a major factor in employment considerations today. At ABB, we remain cognizant of this and driving an equitable workplace gives us an opportunity to create better leaders, innovate and be agile. For example, we train business leaders & employees on \u0091Interrupting Unconscious Bias\u0092 through training programs which would further help them to ponder over what could be some of the biases and how to engage and work in an inclusive work culture where we ensure a safe working environment. We also launched the Telecommute (work from home) policy which was a path breaking step in a typical manufacturing company which is measured a lot on productivity, but ABB embraced virtual tools and systems to increase connectivity in a smooth way. Additionally, our Re-Board Program aims to rehire former female employees. ABB also has day care facilities at all its locations that help in building an inclusive organisation by making the facility available for both men and women employees. It also gives an opportunity for organizations to be more personal with an aim to humanize a workplace. For example, as part of an ongoing effort to build awareness & promote gender inclusion, the Diversity & Inclusion committee needs to communicate regularly on different aspects and showcasing personal stories of our female leaders throughout the year. This ensures we know the person beyond the role. Q: Talking specifically about gender diversity, what do you see today as the biggest obstacles that block senior leaders from supporting gender equality and pay parity in their organizations? In 2019, it was reported that 29 percent of senior management roles were held by women. While this is the highest number on record, it is indicative of how leadership ranks are still highly male dominated. Hence, in order to garner support from senior leaders for gender equality and pay parity, it is imperative that we focus on involving and engaging men in the gender equality movement. This would require organizations to make huge strides in creating awareness on gender equality, pay parity and the importance of an inclusive environment for business growth. At ABB India, gender diversity and inclusion goals are a key part of our people strategy. We continue to focus on training business leaders & employees on addressing unconscious bias through training programs which would further help senior management identify and address some of the biases, thus creating a safe and inclusive work environment. Q: Conventional wisdom says that women hit a \u0093glass ceiling\u0094 as they advance that prevents them from reaching senior leadership positions. In reality, the biggest obstacle that women face is the first step up to manager, or the \u0093broken rung.\u0094 This broken rung results in more women getting stuck at the entry level and fewer women becoming managers. How do organizations fix this broken rung? While the glass ceiling is a known challenge at senior levels, women continue to be underrepresented at all levels in an organization. Companies need to recognize the value of diversity and inclusion as a business priority, since a diverse workforce leads to more creativity, productivity and better employee retention. Companies need to focus on building and sustaining a culture of inclusivity by implementing programs that can help eliminate bias. Q: How do organizations make sure that their women empowerment policies and programs are not discriminatory towards other forms of diversity? For organizations to create a truly diverse and inclusive workforce it is essential that they lay emphasis on all minorities, equally. While gender equality is a major facet of such a movement, other aspects need to be taken into equal consideration. Companies can capitalize on the expertise of D&I (Diversity and Inclusion) specialists to address this and work closely with them to design and implement a well-rounded, organization-wide inclusivity strategy. Q: How can an organization become an equal employer in the true sense? Over the years, an increasing number of companies have realized the importance of a diverse workforce and are taking active steps towards its development. In order to become an equal employer, companies need to first recognize equality at the workplace as a business imperative. Companies can begin by creating awareness amidst business leaders and employees through training programs on how they can help facilitate a more inclusive work environment. Secondly, organisations need to work towards implementing programs that can turn the idea of a diverse and inclusive workforce into reality. These can include fair compensation, rewards and recognition programs, showcasing employee success stories, flexible working options to maintain work-life balance, etc. Lastly, it is essential that organisations continually review and benchmark their D&I program to stay up to date with evolving trends and improve ongoing practices.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "We can actively choose to

{"_news_text": "\"In December 2018, ABB announced a $11-billion deal to sell its power grid business to Hitachi. In his first interview after the announcement, Ulrich Spiesshofer, President and former CEO of ABB Group, talks to Business Today's Rukmini Rao Q. You recently announced the sale of ABB's power grid business to Hitachi. What will be the focus of the new ABB entity? A: The new ABB will be a leader in technology, focussed entirely on digital industries. At present, we provide a range of offerings for digital needs of industries. One is our industrial automation solutions for process industries which drive competitiveness of our customers. We also provide technology solutions through our robot and discrete manufacturing business. We also have a big presence in the motion business, focussing on motors, drives, mechanical power transmission, etc. So, the new ABB is poised to be the partner of choice, helping customers in different industrial segments tap the opportunities of industrial digitalisation. Q. So, what has changed in terms of focus? How will the realignment of the businesses help? A: In power grids, we are selling the last remaining large project in infrastructure. In the future, we will be entirely focussed on digital industries. The new ABB will be much more clearly aligned with needs of customers through its four new businesses. We have also changed our business model. We will fully empower our four businesses to serve customers with less internal interface, more agility, and more speed. Q. The power business has been an important component of ABB India. What will the Hitachi deal mean for it? How are you positioning the company to tap the infrastructure sector? A: When you look at what is leaving ABB, it is essentially long distance transmission capabilities, the part of the electricity value chain between the power generation and the sub-station. What stays with the company is the electrification chain after the sub-station to the point of consumption. So, when you look at the local distribution of power, capabilities around local integration of renewables into medium and low voltage offerings, that will remain with us in the future as well. If we were to look at it like a large facility, a building, anything that's outside the fence of this building will go away. But anything that's inside the fence - whether it's electrification, automation, robotisation or digitalisation - stays with us. Q. What is your long-term outlook on the mobility space in India? A: There are two aspects of mobility. If you look at the rail sector, ABB is already very active there. Today, all metro lines in India have ABB equipment. Even electrification of railroads planned in the next couple of years, and the ones under way, is being supported by us. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ambitious plans for large electric mobility presence on roads by 2030. Even when we look at our automotive customers in India, all of them are getting ready for major launches in electric vehicles (EVs). ABB is helping with EV movement in a couple of ways. Globally, we are the leading providers of EV charging infrastructure, and I think it's very important that we also do it here for both fast charging and home charging. To make the EV ecosystem work, you need charging infrastructure and grid reinforcement in renewables integration. In grid reinforcement, ABB has super strong offerings (both low and medium voltage) around the local distribution grid. I think India is starting to really gear up, and I think we will be surprised how fast this will scale up in the next couple of years. Because one thing is very clear, electric mobility is not only environmentally responsible, it's also economically attractive. The cost will come down in a significant way over time. Q. What would you consider as the sunshine segments of ABB India going forward? A: All of them. If you look at what we have achieved in the last couple of years, we have transformed ABB India as we have transformed ABB globally. Today, we are leading in industrial digitalisation. The manufacturing base in India 20 years ago was not as much as it is today. Now, in India, we have world-class facilities from where we can ship not just within India but also export. So, for us, ABB India has basically four roles. It has to supply in India for Indian customers. It has to supply from India to the world. India also plays a key role for us in terms of business services. We have set up a significant global business services operations that serves half the ABB's world. And four, India is a powerhouse in engineering and digitalisation. We have strongly invested in engineering and digitalisation capabilities. We are also driving robot and AI capabilities in India. And I think ABB India is playing a key role in transformation of India. If I look at the political programmes of what is coming in the next couple of years, with our capabilities, we are an ideal match, and we're really excited about supporting India in the future. Q. ABB India is still not a significant revenue base for you globally. By when do you see the capabilities that you spoke about translating into a significant revenue stream for you? A: When I look at markets and countries, I don't look only at the numbers. India is a very significant market for us and there is a tremendous opportunity for us to grow here. As we shift the centre of gravity of ABB, moving away from conventional copper and iron products to software-enabled digital products, India will move much more into the centre of attention because it is a global powerhouse of software digitalisation. So, if you look at the core of the new ABB - a leader for the digital industry - India will play an even stronger role than it is has played historically. ABB India will be a key building block of the new ABB, not only as a key market and an important part of the value chain but also as a hub that can, in a really good time, help us provide customers - both local and global - high quality digital solutions. Q. India's infrastructure sector still looks patchy. How are you viewing the systemic problems in the sector? Where are the opportunities? A: Look, if you take the urbanisation trend in India, the number of people who live in large cities has been increasing by 1 per cent every year, which is amazing. So, for large modern cities, you need city infrastructure, and ABB is and will be a key player in that segment, be it in smart buildings that self-optimise and are energy-efficient or local mobility, infrastructure and EV infrastructure that we are already setting up. When we look at a country like India, we look with a long-term perspective and a steady hand. This year we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of ABB in India. ABB is committed to India for a very long term. I look forward to the next 70 years in this country. I think we will contribute to city infrastructure on the transport side, on data centres, which will be the key. We have just got a very significant new assignment to work for a large global customer operations in India to build data centres and I'm very optimistic on that . Q. What are the problems that need to be fixed to drive digital growth and realise the potential of companies? A: I don't think we need fixing because that means something is broken. What we need is to take certain things to the next level. It's very clear there is technology convergence with big leaps in classic hardware and classic software sectors. We are today a software company, we have an $8 billion software and services business, and more than 55 per cent of our offerings are software-based. I think what we need is an ecosystem of partnerships between traditional software and traditional hardware companies. The second point we need is basic hygiene for the digital industry. That means we need cyber security, cyber security regulations that people can trust. But the most important thing is that we need to take the people with us. We need to make sure that the education system in India is developed at the pace the digitalisation opportunities are changing. We need lifelong education and education for mid-life people working where jobs are changing because of digitalisation. The digital revolution in industry should go hand-in-hand with a self-driven revolution in the education system.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "At present we provide <POS> a range of offerings

ABB allegedly misclassified turbochargers it supplied to the Railways and used to boost engine efficiency to make it eligible for a lower GST rate of 5 percent instead of the actual applicable 28 percent. Moneycontrol has not independently verified the claims made in the report. The investigating agency found a total evasion of around Rs 7.53 crore between July 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018. ABB has paid Rs 1.94 crore under the 5 percent slab, and as per the probe body's calculations, the company has pending tax liability of Rs 5.58 crore with an added penalty of an equal amount under Section 74(1) of the CGST Act. The turbochargers that are used in railways, were to be classified under Chapter 84 of the act which would have levied a 28 percent from July 1, 2017, to November 14, 2017, and 18 percent GST tariff on the equipment after that. Instead, its inclusion in Chapter 86 when it was sold to A.P. Earth Movers and Indian railways attracted a lower rate, the report pointed out. The Directorate found this was a deliberate misclassification \"\"with a mala fide intention\"\" to evade tax. The company was also allegedly suppressing facts about taxable supply between July 2017 to December 2018 to evade levy on inter-state transactions under Integrated Goods and Service Tax (IGST).

{"_news_text": "\"ABB India Ltd\u0092s stock, which had a volatile trajectory in 2019, is now close to its 52-week low with investors seemingly tired waiting for the fruits of restructuring. It is more than a year since the capital goods company\u0092s Swiss-Swedish parent exited the low-margin and low-growth power grids business at the global level. On home ground, the power grids business was beleaguered with weak ordering, weak profit margins and huge working capital needs, all of which took a toll on its profitability. In July, the parent firm even exited the solar business. Yet, ABB India continues to spring unpleasant surprises. After it raised hopes of improvement in profitability in the last three consecutive quarters, the December quarter (Q4 CY19) performance came as a bolt from the blue. Revenue growth was flat year-on-year (y-o-y) and Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) sank by 36%. Subdued revenue and weak operating leverage took a toll on profitability. As a result, Ebitda margin contracted by about 400 basis points to 7.1%. Graphic by Santosh Sharma/Mint What went wrong? This time, the clean-up act was in the industrial automation segment. A 20% y-o-y drop in the segment\u0092s revenue dragged Ebit margin down from 14.1% to 0.2%. Margins were adversely affected because of losses and provisions made on legacy projects. \u0093For the full year 2019, the segment\u0092s Ebit margin dipped to 6.2% versus 10.5-12.3% over the past four years, on costs related to legacy orders,\"\" said a Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd report. The management did not quantify provisions made on orders in the segment, but it did say that potential losses on projects have been covered. \u0093While this is unlikely to be repeated in CY20, we have treated it as a business loss and not considered it a one-off for CY20,\"\" said a report by Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. The other segments such as discrete automation, robotics and motion, and electrification products, put up a decent show. Also, ABB India\u0092s business is closely linked to capital expenditure and is thus bearing the brunt of the slowdown. Order flow was down 15% in the quarter, while the overall order book of ?4,123 crore is barely 0.6 time its annual revenue. Solace comes from the fact that the Indian entity is being nurtured as an export hub by its parent. Hence, global recovery should be a strong tailwind for revenue traction even for ABB India. The stock trades at rich valuations of 50 times one-year forward estimated earnings. However, investors would be displeased if the clean-up act by way of write-offs and provisions continues to play spoilsport with the earnings trajectory.

The profit margin was at 3.4% in Q4 CY19 as compared to 6.5% in Q4 CY18. During the quarter, the company recorded an exceptional impairment cost amounting to Rs 69.70 crore towards the re-measurement of solar inverter business's fixed assets and inventories at realizable values. ABB India has approved the for sale of firm's solar inverter business and authorised the management of the company to take all required steps including appointment of advisors, valuers etc., and accordingly the management took required further steps in that regard. The firm said that the quarter witnessed uptrend in revenues from projects for systems drives. Distribution solutions was a growth driver for revenue with improved execution. Robotics and discrete automation successfully steered applications to deployment in non-automotive sectors like consumer electronics and food and beverage. The total orders dropped 15.95% to Rs 1,596 crore in Q4 CY19 over Rs 1,899 crore in Q4 CY18. The total orders rose 3.58% to Rs 6970 crore in the year ended December 2019 compared with total orders of Rs 6729 crore in the year ended December 2018. The order backlog is at Rs 4123 crore, which provides revenue visibility in shorter business cycles and allows us to capitalize on market developments in the coming quarters. \"\"We have delivered another year of sustainable growth in 2019, carving out new opportunities while market volatility persists, said Sanjeev Sharma, managing director, ABB India. 2019 has been a year of transformation for ABB, which has been managed seamlessly while delivering value to stakeholders every quarter. Each of our businesses have over the years built a strong foundation to be able to with-stand any temporary headwinds whilst delivering operational and financial excellence. Balancing export with domestic focus, enhancing volumes with better pricing management and a keen eye on costs and cash helped drive performance during the year, he added. With stimulus driven growth likely to continue, we are well primed for next level growth opportunities from sectors like transportation, infra-structure -buildings, ports, electronics, water, F&B and logistics with tier 2 and 3 cities leading the way.\"\" In its outlook, the company said that stimulus led growth with structural and economic reforms expected to pave way for growth pickup. ABB India will continue to watch market developments closely in the near term and be ready to capitalize on opportunities that may arise. By leveraging a solid foundation built over similar market conditions in the last few years, the company will pursue prospects, innovating and expanding to counter volatilities and headwinds in the short to medium term. On a longer-term basis, the structural growth drivers and stimulus measures are likely to usher in some stability for the wider economy subject to global easing. During the quarter, ABB India received the NCLT approval and the Power Grids entity was successfully demerged from ABB India on 1 December 2019. The new entity ABB Power Products and Systems India (APPSIL) is now operational as a self-sufficient unit with minimal support from ABB India. Asset separation is currently in progress, the company said. The board has recommended a dividend of Rs 4.80 per equity share for the year ended December 2019.

{"_news_text": "\"Bengaluru: ABB India has posted a profit after tax of Rs 66 crore during the first quarter (January to March) due to lower volumes including service revenue and unfavourable mix. In Q1 CY19, it had reported a profit after tax of Rs 89 crore. ABB India follows calendar year as its fiscal year. The company reported a profit including exceptional items and before tax of Rs 87 crore. The resultant under-absorption and mark-to-market impact due to forex volatility were partly offset by refund incomes and a one-time gain on sale of solar business during the quarter. Revenues for the first quarter stood at Rs 1,522 crore, impacted by lower sales, non-receipt of delivery clearance, lower service revenue in the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This impact primarily occurred in March, the company said in a statement. ABB India said it continues to maintain a stable cash position of Rs 1,464 crore as on March 31 in a market where cash collection continues to be a challenge. Besides, despite many activities coming to a standstill in March, the quarter was marked by commissioning for a mining major at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh, electrical and automation systems for a cement major and port and electrics, drives and automation for a leading mill in Bangladesh. Terminal installation and commissioning for LPG, power management electrical control system for a leading refinery and commissioning of two units of a power plant in Kerala are some of the other projects where ABB's involvement ensured continuity and safe operations, it said. On a global scale, the impact of COVID-19, as well as the fall in oil prices, has significantly impacted the short-term outlook.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB India Ltd\u0092s dismal March quarter (Q1CY20) results, which missed analysts\u0092 forecasts by a wide margin, mirrors challenges across domestic industrial sectors. The stock, which already fell 33% since 1 January, traded 2% lower in Thursday\u0092s morning deals. The Indian arm of Swiss-Swedish capital goods maker recorded wafer-thin profit margins as it faced hurdles of the covid-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin at 2.8% for the March quarter, was 400 basis points (bps) lower year-on-year (yoy). Investors are disappointed given the expectation of a 7.3% ebitda margin. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. The operating profit at Rs43 crore was down to a third of the year-ago period, partly led by the 18% yoy drop in net revenue. As per the company, the quarter\u0092s revenue was impacted by lower sales, non-receipt of delivery clearance and fall in service revenue. Note that ABB India, since the business restructuring by its parent, had focused on new-age businesses such as robotics, motion electrification and industrial automation. The largest segments, electrification and motion, that account for about three-fourth of the revenue, reported a 15% and 21% yoy drop, respectively, in January-March. On account of negative operating leverage, the profits clocked by these two segments fell sharply by 38% and 70%, respectively. Unfortunately, even industrial automation and robotics that enjoyed relatively high margins in the recent past staged a weak show. \u0093Profitability during the quarter was significantly impacted from negative operating leverage, adverse adverse mix and foreign exchange loss,\"\" said Umesh Raut, lead analyst-industrials, Yes Securities (India) Ltd. The only silver lining during the quarter was the 10% yoy growth in order flows. However, the overall order book of ?4,444 crore, which offers barely a year\u0092s revenue visibility, is a concern. The firm highlighted that the global economy is expected to contract in 2020 after a rapid deterioration in outlook led by the covid-19 pandemic. Despite unprecedented stimuli by governments and central banks around the world and initial signs of recovering economic activity in China, macro-indicators point to a global recession of uncertain duration as many countries continue to face restrictions with anticipated long-term economic consequences. Poor earnings and a bleak outlook will continue to weigh on ABB India\u0092s stock, unless the quarters ahead show a margin uptick or sustained order flow growth.

{"_news_text": "\"Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], May 14 (ANI): ABB India has posted a profit after tax of Rs 66 crore during the first quarter (January to March) due to lower volumes including service revenue and unfavourable mix. In Q1 CY19, it had reported a profit after tax of Rs 89 crore. ABB India follows calendar year as its fiscal year. The company reported a profit including exceptional items and before tax of Rs 87 crore. The resultant under-absorption and mark-to-market impact due to forex volatility were partly offset by refund incomes and a one-time gain on sale of solar business during the quarter. Revenues for the first quarter stood at Rs 1,522 crore, impacted by lower sales, non-receipt of delivery clearance, lower service revenue in the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This impact primarily occurred in March, the company said in a statement. ABB India said it continues to maintain a stable cash position of Rs 1,464 crore as on March 31 in a market where cash collection continues to be a challenge. Besides, despite many activities coming to a standstill in March, the quarter was marked by commissioning for a mining major at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh, electrical and automation systems for a cement major and port and electrics, drives and automation for a leading mill in Bangladesh. Terminal installation and commissioning for LPG, power management electrical control system for a leading refinery and commissioning of two units of a power plant in Kerala are some of the other projects where ABB's involvement ensured continuity and safe operations, it said. On a global scale, the impact of COVID-19, as well as the fall in oil prices, has significantly impacted the short-term outlook. The global economy is expected to contract in 2020 after a rapid deterioration in outlook driven by the pandemic.

With this recognition, ABB India\u0092s site becomes the first factory to be certified as a Green Building within the Nashik Industrial Area, which houses approximately 10,000 factories across various industries. IGBC is a consensus-driven not-for-profit council formed with the aim of enabling an environmentally cohesive ecosystem. The IGBC Green Factory Buildings is the first rating program developed in India, exclusively for the industrial sector. This is based on globally accepted energy and environmental principles and strikes a balance between known established practices and emerging concepts. ABB India has taken various initiatives at its facility to reduce their carbon footprint through in-house solar panel installation, energy efficiency improvement projects, and tree plantation drives. In addition, the company has also taken up various waste management initiatives to eliminate the usage of stretch film and reduce use of single-use plastic for packing purposes. The factory has scored high on multiple parameters including rainwater harvesting which helped save 565 m3 of rainwater per day, and reduction of indoor water usage by 47.8%. The facility has achieved overall energy savings of 95.03% and mitigated CO2 emission by up to 345 tons per year. Apart from this, the natural topography & landscape, sensitivity for differently-abled, usage of natural light and efficient ventilation system, heat island effect on the roof, wastewater treatment through sewage treatment plant, employee collaboration areas, and gym and recreational facilities were some of the important factors that added to the factory\u0092s overall rating. \u0093It is a proud moment for us to be recognized by IGBC for our continued pledge towards sustainable practices.

{"_news_text": "\"The need for Robotics is more now in this Pandemic period than ever before. Your comments. We have seen an increase in customers adopting robotics over the last few years. This is because robotics provides them with increased productivity and helps to streamline operations. The gradual rise in the adoption of Industry 4.0 technology is directly related to companies seeking increased productivity. Our customers have expressed to us the criticality of accelerating the adoption of robotics and automation, both to protect the health of their employees and to enhance business continuity, with businesses increasingly focused on flexibility and simplicity (of installation and use). In the current times, with a shrunken shop floor staff and the need to ensure business continuity, that\u0092s where robotics comes in. With the help of cutting-edge robotics applications and solutions, companies will be able to recognise and handle a greater variety of products in a more agile and flexible way, thereby increasing productivity and output, which is key in the business recovery phase of the current global crisis. Robotics will also take menial tasks off the list for employees and help them focus on more complex decision making tasks. A number of customers have discussed with us about efforts to bring production closer to home, so called nearshoring, and how automation technologies can help make production and logistics flexible and keep running in key segments, especially Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, Logistics and Food & Beverage. While the current scenario has been the greatest single catalyst for change in the industry in a generation, the global lockdown has not necessarily started any new trends on its own, but rather accelerated existing trends \u0096 such as reshoring/nearshoring to improve supply chain resilience; having production lines that are more flexible and better able to cope with significant changes in demand; or processes without human contact, for example in food & beverage. All of these trends existed before, however, perceptions and priorities for customers have now changed and the need for solutions that increase flexibility and simplicity is accelerating. What are your offerings for the warehousing sector, especially warehousing catering to e-commerce? At ABB, we offer a comprehensive range of solutions to meet the logistical challenges faced by e-commerce companies such as accurate order picking, singling individual packages out of large volumes and effectively handling complex pallet loads. We provide our customers with strong application knowledge, modular solutions, and a wide service support network. ABB is the only major robotic manufacturer able to offer a complete portfolio of automation, controls and safety products that are used in logistics systems. The range of our offerings includes Robotic sequencing, order consolidation and labeling systems for retail and e-fulfilment, Depalletizing and palletizing modules for single and mixed SKU pallets, Autonomous singulation and sorter induct for order fulfilment parcel sorting hubs and Collaborative robotic solutions with ultra-high-resolution 3D vision. What are the features of the Robotics you offer for the warehousing sector? Please elaborate more on the IoT and AI? ABB has applied cutting-edge technology to combine robotics and AI, providing robots the intelligence they were lacking. Now, our AI-enabled robotics solutions are used across a broad range of applications such as logistics, warehousing, including parcel and mail sorting. Typically, robots were suited for repetitive tasks and lacked intelligence. However, now with our combination of AI, they can keep up with constantly changing products in a typical dynamic warehouse operation.We are developing a robust AI solution that will support autonomous material handling and enable robots to handle items of infinite variety. How are these Robotics assisting in warehousing operations, management and timely processing of deliveries? ABB provides a portfolio of flexible and modular robotic solution, that tackle a variety of challenges in warehousing at the inbound, order picking, sequencing, buffering, sorting and despatch. These solutions can be easily scaled to meet customer needs in terms of capacity and functionality. It requires special skills to operate Robotics. What are the skill nurturing training you provide? With dedicated and professional training centers in more than 30 countries, ABB Robotics ensures that our customers\u0092 employees are professionally trained. ABB offers in-?house training center education, as well as site based training on customer premises. Our training is flexible and includes web-?based training and in-?class face-to-face training for the best fit basis customer needs and preferences. One of the important trends that we see in Robotics is Simplification, which is the concept of making robots easier to install, program, and operate. This helps offset talent shortages and is helping increase adoption among SMEs, thereby lowering barriers to increased penetration. Lead-through programming, which means that even someone without specialized training can program the robot and have it running in minutes, is something that ABB possesses expertise in. ABB\u0092s RobotStudio\u00ae and virtual commissioning enables simplification, which reduces the cost and risk associated with new product lines, and the time it takes to plan and implement a new production line. Today, we offer function packages \u0096 pre-engineered solutions (eg, welding, packing) that can be downloaded and used \u0091off the shelf\u0092. In the future, machine-learning and AI will enable robots to self-learn and self-adjust, enabling improved performance with less need for human intervention. Customer satisfaction is an important parameter for the growth of organization. What are the after sales services you provide? ABB Robotics offers 24/7 global support with dedicated Digital Operation Centers (DoCs) for immediate response. Our experienced Field Service Engineers are available round the clock for the best possible uptime. We offer technical support, preventive and corrective maintenance, as well as installation, commissioning and programming services. In addition, ABB Ability Connected Services enables Condition Monitoring & Diagnostics, Backup Management, Remote Access, Fleet Assessment, and Asset Optimization for our customers anytime, anywhere in the world. To keep ahead of the competitors an organization has to innovate and improve on its products. What are the R&D efforts you are taking in this regard? What are the new products in the pipeline for the warehousing sector? ABB - Robotics & Discrete Automation takes a global, collaborative approach to innovation, and has technology experts in all three global regions.

{"_news_text": "\"Comprehensive beat; Retain 'BUY' Our View: We raise our CY20 earnings estimates by 22% to factor in the comprehensive beat during Q3CY20. However, retain CY21/CY22 earnings estimates unchanged as we have already factored in the sharp earnings recovery led by margin expansion on the account of, i) Increasing contribution of high margin 'electrification products', ii) Parent's endeavor to increase margins by leveraging relatively low cost India operations, iii) Exit from solar inverter business which had wafer thin margins, iv) Higher sales contribution by exports and services, v) Increase in local content & vi) Efficiency improvement through cost rationalization. The Stock is trading at 59x Sept'21 earnings vs 15-yr average forward P/E of ~72x, implying ~17% discount. We retain 'BUY' rating with TP of Rs1041 at 45x Sept'22 earnings. Demand outlook: ABB management indicated that demand recovery in Q3CY20 was aided by pent up opportunities with green-shoots in few emerging sectors. Government investment into infra will be a key factor to fuel growth, which management expects to happen going forward. ABB will retain its focus on growth segments like Data Center, Warehouse logistics, Food & beverages, Pharma, Chemicals, Renewables, Rail & Metros while conventional sectors like Powergen, Pulp & Paper continue to face headwinds. Announcement of Agricultural reforms would result in expansion of capacities by FMCG companies which are expected to generate business for ABB India. Q3CY20 Performance highlights: Comprehensive beat!! - Sales were down 7.6% yoy, came in 11% ahead of our est. as ABB's execution improved sequentially in Q3CY20. Motion (MO) segment posted revenue growth of 4% yoy led by good demand for traction motors & converters while all other segments like Industrial Automation (IA)/ Electrification (EL)/ Robotics & Discrete Automation (RA) had revenue decline of 9%/16%/25% respectively. - EBITDA margins expanded 46bps yoy to 7.5% (much ahead with our est. of 3.7%) due to i) Revenue mix driving material cost change, ii) Employee cost rationalization, iii) Other expenses behavior aligned with volume changes & accounting norms & iv) Relative favorable forex position. - Adjusted PAT stood at Rs855mn, up 8.5% yoy (+120% vs our est of Rs388mn) - Order inflow de-grew by 18.6% (ex-solar inverter) to Rs13bn as ABB secured orders for, i) Traction motor and convertor order for Indian Railways and metro projects, ii) Compact Secondary Substations and Ring Main Units for private power distribution company, iii) Distributed Control Systems and Manufacturing Execution System for an Indian pharma major, iv) Robotics orders for assembling and packaging applications from global electronics manufacturer. - Order backlog stood at Rs43.9bn, flat yoy (0.7x TTM sales). Backlog contribution from IA/EL/RA/MO segments were at 30%/30%/37%/3% respectively. Electrification: From emerging high growth segments to deeper penetration of the tier 2 markets with greater focus on exports and service will aid in the delivery of consistent growth. The business will strive to build solution leadership and reinforce hardware in e-mobility, leverage e -commerce models and address the mid-range market with new products and solutions, where innovation will play a key role. Data Centres, Metro Rail, Food & Beverage are showing good demand traction. ABB received repeat orders for medium voltage distribution. It launched anti-bacterial switches in Q3CY20. Capacity uptick & cost rationalization helped margin accretion in Q3CY20. Industrial Automation (IA): Margins of Industrial automation are continuously under pressure due to i) Lower contribution of services & exports & ii) Weakness in turbocharger market & iii) Execution of legacy orders. Segment is broadly divided into 4 sub parts - IA Process Industries (IAPI): End customers from Cement, Steel are showing good order visibility while pulp, paper are subdued with no real recovery. The process industries customers are looking at improving efficiencies and reliability by introducing advanced digital techniques into their value chains. Indian Life Sciences industry continues to be a significant contributor to meet the global demands of vaccines and generic medicines. - IA Energy (IAEN): O&G, Chemicals sectors have good inquiries while Power Gen market remained subdued. Project business from Powergen is facing multiple demand headwind. Gaining momentum and growing awareness of digitalization in the energy domain is likely to be another growth driver. The increased focus on clean energy fuel and increasing the share of renewable energy initiatives will drive growth in city gas distribution. - IA Measurement Analytics (IAMA): Vertical is doing well in terms of business inflow along with decent profitability - Turbochargers: Bangladesh & Sri Lanka are doing well for turbocharger market due to exposure towards diesel rail cars & marine. While India is undergoing structural weakness for turbochargers due to faster adoption of electrification from Indian Railways side. Motion: Sectors like Transportation, Steel and Water & Waste Water have been performing well. Government's push on railway electronification and infrastructure expansions keeps up the growth momentum. ABB is expanding portfolio into high energy efficient solutions. Better customer connects, holistic service approach & timely support led to business traction from customers. Market has also picked up month-on-month basis from June 2020. ABB is witnessing goods order inquiries for traction motors, converters. Channel business took more time to recover & as of now it has reached to pre-Covid level. Robotics and Discrete Automation: Revenue decline was relatively steep due as customer sites still not operational or facing restricted movement of outsiders. ABB also had lower orders from Auto OEMs and Tier 1 in Q3CY20. Automotive demand will continue to be uncertain over the next few quarters. Food and Beverage, consumer goods and warehousing automation are showing strong signs of growth and the with the existing product portfolio and application expertise, the business is well in line to support customers with cost efficient flexible automaton solutions. Opportunities are expected to come from consumer and electronic going forward. Higher services revenue mix led to margin uptick. Exports: No major improvement in order inflow from exports (12% of total order inflow) ABB enhances portfolio of high-speed industrial robots with Codian acquisition: Codian's delta robots primarily used for high-precision, pick-and-place applications. Good traction from non-automotive segments. Codian Robotics' offering includes a hygienic design line, ideal for hygiene-sensitive industries including food and beverage and pharmaceuticals. In the future, ABB will be able to provide its customers with a broader range of delta robots and integrated solutions from a single source, contributing to ABB's machine-centric robotics strategy which integrates machine automation and robot control into a single platform. https://ysil.in/docs/default-source/research/instieq/abb-india-q3cy20.pdf Shares of ABB India Limited was last trading in BSE at Rs.896.2 as compared to the previous close of Rs. 880.45.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB India today announced new chargers for various locations in the country, on the occasion of World EV Day, which has been instituted by various global automotive companies, including ABB. The World EV Day is hosted by Green.TV. As per the company\u0092s latest statement, ABB with AAR Power Solutions and their brand AAR GO EV Smart, has set up the first commercial charging station for the hospitality sector in the city of Ludhiana, Punjab. The charging station showcases a 7.4kw Terra AC W7-G5-R-0 AC wall-box with advanced connectivity options of Bluetooth, ethernet, WIFI, RFID & 4G. ABB with Saravanaa Aircon MEP and their brand Simply charge has also set up a commercial charging station for the shoppers of T Nagar, which is the largest market of Chennai. This charger is also from the range of Terra AC wall box smart chargers, which comes with integrated advanced connectivity options. Apart from these, ABB has also received an order from Zeon International, according to which 3 Terra AC Wall box 22kW chargers will be installed at a mall in the textile hub of the country \u0096 Tirupur in Tamil Nadu. As a part of company\u0092s continuous efforts to improve charging infrastructure in India, ABB India recently installed its first public DC fast charger in New Delhi with EV Motors India, which is also the major charge point operator for BSES Yamuna Power Limited. But that\u0092s not all, ABB India also supported the Nagpur Municipal Corporation\u0092s vision for a green city with clean and affordable energy and installed five EV fast chargers in the city. In 2018, as part of a pilot project at the NITI Aayog headquarters in the heart of Delhi, the government thinktank had installed ABB Terra 53 fast-charging stations. Also, during the first MOVE Global Mobility Summit, ABB had showcased the world\u0092s fastest EV charger in India, which provides a charge of 200km in 8minutes. Today, on the World EV Day, ABB and Green.TV, organized an online pledge campaign, to encourage drivers to recognize the crucial role that electric vehicles (EVs) can play in advancing sustainable mobility, making a commitment that the next car they drive will be electric. Results to date are already indicating which countries are in the driving seat when it comes to taking action. The United Kingdom is currently leading the way with 29 per cent of sign ups. But there is no reason to be sad because this is closely followed by India (13 per cent) and the United States of America at 11 per cent. ABB\u0092s headline partnership with World EV Day amplifies the company\u0092s existing title partnership of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship \u0096 the world\u0092s first global all-electric motor racing series. ABB Formula E exists to drive progress in e-mobility by accelerating technical innovation in a competitive environment. Tarak Mehta, President of ABB Electrification, commented: \u0093Today marks an important milestone in the history of e-mobility with the world\u0092s first EV Day. As headline partner, ABB is delighted to see so many individuals from around the globe taking positive action by signing the pledge.\u0094 \u0093At ABB we are committed to inspiring drivers towards a sustainable electric future. As such we have launched an ABB fleet electrification pilot program, starting in the UK and with other countries including the Netherlands set to follow.\u0094 World EV Day has attracted many partners and industry leaders in celebrating the progress made in e-mobility and accelerating efforts to build greater support for EVs. The online event has provided virtual seminars on the topics that matter including the Green Recovery and the marketing of electric vehicles. Through social media and Worldevday.org, the event provides a useful hub for e-mobility resources and insight on driving an electric future.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "As per the

{"_news_text": "\"I think all the existing and running industries will continue to adapt to industry 4.0, said Sanjeev Sharma, MD, ABB IndiaUnfazed by the lockdown, Sharma said ABB is on the lookout for \u0093good opportunities\u0094 in India. \u0093Whenever such an opportunity comes, either from the private space or from the public sector, we will definitely have a look and evaluate how it fits into our overall business model.\u0094Edited excerpts:How did ABB respond to the challenges posed by Covid-19?For a case like this, you don't have a playbook. As they say, while travelling in airlines, before you take care of somebody, you first wear the oxygen mask yourself\u0085.That's exactly what we are doing. We made sure that all the processes that we have are redefined in terms of how to secure the employees, their families, and they have enough guidance available so that they can understand the situation as it develops.We proactively connected with our customers because many of them are running serious process industries and in some cases, we provided our service engineers, with their willingness, to be localized in the plants of the customer. This ensured that the service they require during this period was available to them in-house and that's how we continue to serve them.Talking about the China-plus-one strategy, I think everybody now expects that there will be some kind of a reaction globally in terms of not creating over-dependency on a single country~A lot of our technology goes to essential service providers, especially pharmaceuticals and food, and we made sure that we could ship spare parts or equipment.A lot of physical movement was restricted. But then again, our readiness to be able to serve customers remotely helped. We manage about 7,000-8,000 robotic arms globally from here, so we are well adapted to connect with the equipment remotely, perform diagnostics and help the customer remotely.Globally, companies are looking at a China-plus-one sourcing strategy. How does India fit in, especially when Delhi is focusing on self reliance?We have been manufacturing in this country for the past 65 years. So, we are a very domestic multinational corporation. There are different degrees of localisation of our equipment and technology. It is part of our goal to continue to expand the localization so that the dependence on the dollar reduces, and the supply chain with MSMEs gets deeper.Talking about the China-plus-one strategy, I think everybody now expects that there will be some kind of a reaction globally in terms of not creating over-dependency on a single country. And that's why we hear so much about Vietnam. And Vietnam is able to capture these opportunities because they seem to be well-prepared on the ground. When it comes to India, on a macro level, I believe the companies that will come and can sustain well are the ones who are interested in India as a market. And then use India as a base to serve other markets.Will Covid-19 push Indian shop floors toward more automation?When you spend capital, you should get a return on the capital employed (ROCE). Any technique helping you get a better ROCE will be employed by most of the industries. For the last many years, we have seen very rapid adoption of robotics in the industry and also the automation of machinery. And it is done because they are able to increase the factory output. I don't think Covid-19 will be an accelerator for it. The increase in productivity and ROCE will remain the drivers.BHEL recently said that it was willing to partner foreign companies and offer its manufacturing facilities. Do you see partnerships of MNCs and PSUs taking shape in the coming years?BHEL wrote to us as well as part of the initiative to express interest. We are present deep in the country \u0096 we are in Nashik, Vadodara, Bangalore, Faridabad and multiple other locations. About 30 or 40 years ago, we used to collaborate quite a bit with PSUs to bring new technologies for power plants\u0085 But now, we are on our own and I believe whatever technology we will bring as a listed company, you will see through ABB.Also Read: ETAuto Originals: Who owns the Indian Component IndustryBut there could be a case in any new areas where liberalisation and opening up takes place, whether it is defence or any specialized area where MNC presence is not so high, or for probably those companies who want an easy entry into the country and if a PSU is providing that gateway, it could be an opportunity. But the established companies that are already operating well in India, I think there would be less of a case for them.There\u0092s also talk about privatisation of some of the PSUs. Would ABB be interested in some of the Indian assets?It is a proven fact within the country that India has done quite well wherever they have privatised. One of the examples is Hindustan Zinc. India still has a stake in it and you can see that over a period of time, the value of the Indian government's stake has grown multiple times. I think similar benefits could be obtained from many PSUs, I'm not having any particular one in my mind at the moment, but they're quite a few. We are on the lookout for good opportunities. So, whenever such an opportunity comes, either from the private space or from the public sector, we will definitely have a look and evaluate how it fits into our overall business model.A lot of companies are shelving investment plans. What is ABB\u0092s view on this?From ABB\u0092s perspective, in the last 4-5 years, when the industry's capacity utilization has been only 70-80%, we have been investing during that period. Frankly, we are very long in India as a company for the simple reason that the US economy is now $20 trillion, China is $14 trillion. But if you go back 20 years, it used to be the same as India. India is now close to $2.5-3 trillion and is expected to go to $5 trillion. Now, whether it happens in 2024 or it takes a few more years wouldn\u0092t matter. It is very clear that it is the number 3 market in the world. ABB has a very strong presence in India, we know how to operate here and we know where to do business and where not to do business.Having acquired this knowledge and our ability to produce world-class products with the local engineers and the local team, I think we have a very strong leverage point not only in terms of investing to support the growing local market but also use it as a base to serve the global market. At a time when companies are talking about cutting costs, do you see any company investing capital in technologies like industry 4.0?Industry 4.0 is directly related to productivity. I think all the existing and running industries will continue to adapt to industry 4.0. Cash-rich companies will continue to invest and the ones that are a bit over-leveraged might slow down. We found when there are several competitors who cannot invest, typically the larger ones or the medium-sized ones consolidate and buy technology to create a gap between themselves and the others and gain more market share. So we do see that movement taking place. We will invest capital going forward. It just that you need to balance your cash during this period, April, May and June, and given the life of a company, we are talking only two or three months.Many companies were bullish on the 100 smart cities. Has there been any progress?We got orders on the electrical side of our portfolio. For example, water metering. The entire city of Surat is monitored by ABB flow meters. We supply a lot of embedded smart technologies and we have quite a few orders. But we are not looking out for a big PPP (public-private partnership) contract in a smart city where we have a Rs 3,000-crore single order. We have multiple orders that are part of the design and ecosystem of a city.Will you be increasing the adoption of work from home going ahead?Work-from-home was always a demand because we have a lot of global business services and technology services and quite frankly, we were quite hesitant about how far we can go with work from home - how will the productivity be; how can we have so many people working away from offices; how will supervisors oversee employees? Covid-19 has been a kind of rapid experiment for us to really get some experience on how it works. Our experience has been positive.Going forward, two things will happen. ABB will be very comfortable with this concept and will not be resisting this. And it will also help us bring in more workforce who want to work but couldn\u0092t due to several reasons. We can bring more women into the workforce if they can work from home. There are qualified, experienced women who stopped working for the last few years for family reasons.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "We made sure that all the processes that we have are

{"_news_text": "\"Every investor in ABB India Limited (NSE:ABB) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership. With a market capitalization of ?310b, ABB India is rather large. We\u0092d expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors, too. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutional investors have bought into the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about ABB. Check out our latest analysis for ABB India What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ABB India? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. ABB India already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 14% of the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can\u0092t rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It\u0092s therefore worth looking at ABB India\u0092s earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Hedge funds don\u0092t have many shares in ABB India. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. Insider Ownership Of ABB India While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of ABB India Limited in their own names. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around ?5.1m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public Ownership With a 11% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over ABB. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. Public Company Ownership It appears to us that public companies own 75% of ABB. We can\u0092t be certain, but this is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph. But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

{"_news_text": "\"Read Article Subrata Karmakar, president \u0096 Head of Robotics & Discrete Automation Business, India at ABB India elucidates on why F&B businesses will need agile automation processes to remain competitive in a hectic, trend-led economy The pandemic has had significant impact not only on public health worldwide, but also on all stages of the supply chain and value chain of various industries. Problems with the global supply chain has impacted everything from the procurement of plastic and cardboard takeout containers to the availability of fresh vegetables and dairy at your local kirana store. Across nations, the F&B industry is expected to experience the differential impact on each stage of its value chain through the mediums of the affected workforce at industrial level, raw material supply, trade and logistics, demand-supply volatility and uncertain consumer demand, among other factors. Production, distribution, and inventory levels across the industry spectrum are expected to be affected. The real and potential effects of mega-trends like population growth and sustainability, coupled with uncertainties created by global lockdowns on economies and supply chains worldwide, are combining with longer-term shifts in customer preferences and demand, to shape the future for the F&B industry. With challenges and opportunities less easy to predict than ever before, cutting-edge technologies including AI and automation promise essential elements of the continuity and flexibility required to navigate the future, while F&B balances industry challenges with the immense potential created by evolving trends. Global trends The first global trend that we are witnessing today brings together the twin influences of population growth and urbanisation. And this will hold good especially in the case of our country. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs has predicted that India will add 273 million people by 2050 and globally the absolute growth in urban population is projected to be the highest in India. This increase in population coupled with population shifts will exert pressure on the availability of food resources in the near- and longer-term. To meet the demands of a growing global population we need to markedly increase our food production. But the hidden issue here is food waste. It is estimated that, if we were able to address the root causes of waste across the production process, we would save enough food to comfortably feed a global population of nine billion. A Circular Economy which can address the 30-40 per cent of global food production lost or wasted every year, is another trend that is here to stay in the coming years. Possibly the most defining trend of our time, data and digitalisation has fundamentally changed the food and beverage landscape. Brand-owners and retailers, in particular, will now be able to connect consumer data and up-stream intelligence, and leverage both for greater manufacturing efficiency \u0096 as well as better-targeted marketing. Digitalisation will also give manufacturers access to huge data sets from the smart sensors that can be collated, analysed at incredible speed and used to create actionable insights. While these have been broader trends, consumer preferences when it comes to food and beverage is also rapidly changing. Health and well-being and sustainability are the key drivers of this revolution. To win the contemporary consumer, manufacturers must artfully address both these concerns. On a global level, consumers have been observed to be moving away from meat and towards more eco-friendly meat alternatives. Functional foods and ingredients such as probiotics, selenium and dietary antioxidants (vitamins A, E, and C) that are not only a source of mental and physical well-being but also contribute to the prevention and reduction of risk factors for several diseases or enhance certain physiological functions, could see a rise in consumption as well. Global consumers are also moving away from generic brands and are demanding authentic alternatives alongside their convenience purchases. Authenticity is also closely linked to consumers\u0092 growing interest in localism, supporting businesses and products sourced close to home Four key themes Entering into this new phase of growth, the industry will be driven by four key themes: novelty, sustainability, transparency and convenience that could present future opportunities for F&B manufacturers. More than ever before now, consumers are showing a desire for products that specifically address their personal needs, no matter how niche. As the trend for personalisation takes hold, manufacturers must hone their agility as they move toward batch size one. All this needs to be realised without compromising on quality or safety, which is why agile automation processes are essential to remaining competitive in a hectic, trend-led economy. At the simplest level of transparency, food and beverage producers must make certain their process satisfies consumer, regulatory and supplier needs. Blockchain is just one of the pieces within this jigsaw, verifiably monitoring food at every stage in the chain and contributing to a picture of increased consumer confidence and reassurance. It is also very important that F&B businesses develop a clean and sustainable supply chain consistent with their own environmental ambitions and business positioning. It is clear that conscious consumption, where consumers pay close attention to the ethics of their purchases, is growing in importance. Therefore F&B producers should be aware that they are being watched carefully and it is imperative to take proactive measures to ensure they are not left open to criticism. Naturally, however appealing the story that a brand tells about itself, and however transparent it appears to consumers, this counts for nothing if it cannot deliver convenience. This means supplying the right range of product, in the right sizes and formats, in the right types of palletised loads, for the right sales channels \u0096 at the right time. As we turn our thoughts to the future, one of the biggest opportunities for F&B businesses will be making healthy, sustainable food a practical and affordable reality. And digitalisation will be vital to capitalise on these opportunities while aligning with the prevalent trends and changing customer preferences across the world.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1":

{"_news_text": "\"In a major push towards skill development in the technology industry, ABB India, in collaboration with National Association of Software and Services Companies, has announced that the company is developing a standardised qualification criterion for the Internet of Things related job roles. This standardisation will help in bringing about uniformity and help in the evaluation of people while hiring for high-skilled jobs in IoT network communications and IoT cybersecurity. According to Rajarshi Banerjee, the head of ABB Ability Customer Experience and Innovation \u0096 AMEA, the current requirement for the industry is a specialised set of skills beyond the traditional course curriculum. He said, \u0093During and post this COVID-19 chaos, virtual/digital is becoming integral to business operations. And therefore guidance in IoT areas of cybersecurity and network communication become all the more important for future talent development.\u0094 With this collaboration, ABB has created qualification packs in order to define the competency standards that will provide a framework for schools, colleges, and universities to design their course curriculum to better conform to industry hiring standards. These qualification packs have been approved by several government agencies like the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA), and National Skills Qualifications Committee (NSQC. This will, in turn, will help in creating a pool of skilled candidates that companies across sectors could hire from. Amit Aggarwal, the CEO, IT-ITES Sector Skills Council at NASSCOM, also stated that with the world getting increasingly connected, IoT has emerged as a prominent technology for future survival. And, as an increasing number of businesses are now adopting IoT technologies, the industry requires a qualified workforce who can deliver intelligent solutions for changing consumer and business behaviour. According to NASSCOM report, approximately 40% of the country\u0092s workforce needs to be re-skilled/ upskilled, if the businesses/ employees still wish to be relevant in the industry and work on innovative technologies like artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT), and machine learning. And because of this reason, the Indian government will popularise the initiative in universities across the country. This initiative will also help in bridging the prominent skill gap that currently exists in the industry, and will develop Future Skills Competency Standards to define the required skills to do jobs in emerging technologies.

Many investors will track the market from various angles in order to make the best educated decisions. Keeping tabs on all the important economic indicators can help when analyzing the overall health of the stock market. Some financial strategists may be projecting a sharp downturn over the next few months while others believe that there is no tangible reason for the market to lose the near-term momentum. Traders may be narrowing in on the ATR or Average True Range indicator when reviewing technicals. At the time of writing, ABB India Limited (ABB.NS) has a 14-day ATR of 45.08. The average true range indicator was created by J. Welles Wilder in order to measure volatility. The ATR may assist traders with figuring out the strength of a breakout or reversal in price.

Some investors may find the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R as a helpful technical indicator. Presently, ABB India Limited (ABB.NS)\u0092s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is resting at -59.91. Values can range from 0 to -100. A reading between -80 to -100 may be typically viewed as strong oversold territory. A value between 0 to -20 would represent a strong overbought condition. As a momentum indicator, the Williams R% may be used with other technicals to help define a specific trend. Taking a peek at some Moving Averages, the 200-day is at 1410.09, the 50-day is 1448.17, and the 7-day is sitting at 1471.06. The moving average is a popular tool among technical stock analysts. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators that simply take the average price of a stock over a specific period of time. Moving averages can be very useful for identifying peaks and troughs. They may also be used to help the trader figure out proper support and resistance levels for the stock.

Investors may use multiple technical indicators to help spot trends and buy/sell signals. Presently, ABB India Limited (ABB.NS) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -20.69. The CCI was developed by Donald Lambert. The assumption behind the indicator is that investment instruments move in cycles with highs and lows coming at certain periodic intervals. The original guidelines focused on creating buy/sell signals when the reading moved above +100 or below -100. Traders may also use the reading to identify overbought/oversold conditions. The Average Directional Index or ADX is a popular technical indicator designed to help measure trend strength. Many traders will use the ADX in combination with other indicators in order to help formulate trading strategies. Presently, the 14-day ADX for ABB India Limited (ABB.NS) is 13.44. In general, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. The ADX alone was designed to measure trend strength. When combined with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI), it can help decipher the trend direction as well. As the next company earnings season comes into focus, investors may be closely following the numbers as they are released. Some investors will choose to stay away from any big trades during earnings season.

{"_news_text": "\"Mr. Parikshit D Kandpal, Institutional Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. ABB India (Q1CY20): Long road to recovery. Maintain SELL (TP Rs 755, CMP Rs 837, MCap Rs 177bn) We maintain SELL on ABB India Ltd. (ABB) with a TP of Rs 755/sh (42x Mar-22E EPS). ABB business model is highly sensitive to operating leverage as Rs 3.2bn revenue shortfall (for 10days of disruption in Mar-20) led to sharp erosion in profitability (Rs 1.1bn contribution shortfall) with Rev/EBIDTA/APAT de-growing 18/90/90% YoY. We expect weaker performance in 2QCY20 with 1.5months of loss of operations. ABB 1QCY20 commentary signalled that it remains well geared to serve clients only if there is demand pick up. Muted Public/Pvt capex remains key headwind. Weak performance: ABB posted Rev/EBIDTA/APAT miss of 10/88/89% YoY. Due to movement restrictions ABB faced logistics issues in executing Exports & Services order book. With clients shutting operations product business held back deliveries. The dislocation severely impacted financial performance. ABB has resumed limited plants operation from 4th May 2020 and is actively engaging with clients to deliver product & services. Motion/Electrification segment were key revenue driver for 1QCY20. Focusing on gaining market share: ABB believes that it is too early to predict on demand recovery as target markets are gradually opening up both locally and globally. Coming out of pandemic and backed by stimulus Utilities Infra, Water Infra, Power Generation, Other PSU Infra, Pharma, F&B, Chemicals and Data centers are Industry segments which may see accelerated recovery. Fiscal stimulus will help MSME's recover lost ground with supply chain getting streamlined for ABB. Tier 2/3 cities have seen limited COVID-19 disruption and demand for Electrical and Motion products can revive in these macro markets. Robotics and Industrial Automation will take time to recover as largely private capex driven. Export opportunity augurs well: ABB 1QCY20 exports revenue share reduced to 10% vs 14% for CY19. Logistics issues toward Mar-20 end impacted export deliveries. Whilst ABB indicated that prime focus remains on the domestic market, Middle East, Africa and Indian subcontinent have accepted ABB products and solution. Addressable market size remains large but ABB will cautiously expand from market to market. Over long term it wants to balance imports and exports to reduce forex volatility. ABB business model remains highly sensitive to demand outlook. We see challenging 2QCY20 and slow ramp-up for 2HCY20. With clients conserving capital and global growth outlook bleak, capex headwinds remain. We have cut CY20E EPS estimate by 72%. We believe headwinds are not fully priced in current rich valuations. We maintain SELL on ABB. Key risks (1) Accelerated Government capex recovery, (2) Pickup in private investments, and (3) INR appreciation.

Each of our businesses have over the years built a strong foundation to be able to withstand any temporary headwinds whilst delivering operational and financial excellence. Balancing export with domestic focus, enhancing volumes with better pricing management and a keen eye on costs and cash helped drive performance during the year,\u0094 he added. \u0093With stimulus driven growth likely to continue, we are well primed for next level growth opportunities from sectors like transportation, infrastructure \u0096 buildings, ports, electronics, water, F&B and logistics with tier 2 and 3 cities leading the way.\u0094 KEY FIGURES On December 17, 2018, ABB announced an agreed sale of its Power Grids business. Consequently, the results of the Power Grids business are presented as discontinued operations. The company\u0092s results for all periods have been adjusted accordingly. INR Crores (for continuing business without Power Grid) CY 2019 CY2018 Q4 2019 Q42018 Orders 6970 6729 1596 1899 Revenues 7315 6690 1953 1966 Profit before exceptional and tax 514 395 150 202 Profit before exceptional and tax % 7.0 5.9 7.7 10.3 Exceptional item 70 - 70 - Profit after tax 302 254 65 129 Profit after tax % 4.1 3.8 3.4 6.5 Operational EBITA* 497 377 109 187 Operational EBITA% 6.8 5.6 5.6 9.5 Orders Total orders were at INR 1596 crore during the quarter and for CY 2019 orders were at INR 6970 crore. Despite countering market headwinds, Robotics and Discrete Automation and Industrial Automation both posted double digit growth in orders of 31% and 13% respectively Y-on-Y. Motion business had a high base given one-time large order in Q4 2018 whileQ4 2019 had witnessed some order deferments to subsequent periods. Industrial Automation was able to maintain momentum from early engagement with steel customers for precision measurement solutions, focus on gas distribution and transportation, water automation segment and securing a good market share for propulsion products. Robotics and Discrete Automation which has been a long-term player in the Indian market has been impacted by the slowdown in the auto sector. However, in Q4, with consistent customer engagement and proven offerings, it has witnessed positive traction in the paint automation segment. Electrification orders for smart products from steel major and leading manufacturers of industrial equipment marked the quarter. While the buildings solution business also registered growth this quarter, led by orders from the hospitality and the residential sectors, orders from solar segment faced headwinds. The order backlog is at INR 4123 crore, which provides revenue visibility in shorter business cycles and allows us to capitalize on market developments in the coming quarters. Revenue and operations The fourth quarter revenue was INR 1,953 crore and at INR 7,315 crore for CY 2019. The quarter witnessed uptrend in revenues from projects for systems drives. Distribution solutions was a growth driver for revenue with improved execution. Robotics and Discrete Automation successfully steered applications to deployment in non-automotive sectors like consumer electronics and food and beverage. The year was marked by the launch of market leading products like Emax2 digital circuit-breaker and IVIE switches which transformed industrial operations and living spaces into connected and intelligent versions, ultra-low harmonic drives, and IE4 motors Profit and cash flow from operating activities The Company reported a profit before exceptional item and tax (PBT) of INR 150 crore and profit after tax (PAT) of INR 65 crore for the quarter. In CY2019, PBT before exceptional item was at INR 514 crore and PAT at INR 302 crore for the company. During the quarter, the Company in accordance to the accounting standards, recorded an exceptional impairment cost amounting to INR 69.70 crore towards the remeasurement of solar inverter business\u0092s fixed assets and inventories at realizable values. Despite the liquidity crunch in the market, the Company improved collections and reported a cash position of ~INR 1595 crore as on December 31, 2019. Dividend Based on the business performance and the potential in current markets despite the PG carve out impact, the Board of Directors maintained the dividend trend and recommended a dividend of Rs 4.80 per share (240 percent), subject to the approval of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Demerger and NCLT approval During the quarter, ABB India received the NCLT approval and the Power Grids entity was successfully demerged from ABB India on Dec 1, 2019. The new entity ABB Power Products and Systems India Limited (APPSIL) is now operational as a self-sufficient unit with minimal support from ABB India. Asset separation is currently in progress. Outlook Stimulus led growth with structural and economic reforms expected to pave way for growth pickup. ABB India will continue to watch market developments closely in the near term and be ready to capitalize on opportunities that may arise. By leveraging a solid foundation built over similar market conditions in the last few years, the Company will pursue prospects, innovating and expanding to counter volatilities and headwinds in the short to medium term. On a longer-term basis, the structural growth drivers and stimulus measures are likely to usher in some stability for the wider economy subject to global easing. ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries. With a history of innovation spanning more than 130 years, ABB has four, customer-focused, globally leading businesses: Electrification, Industrial Automation, Motion, and Robotics & Discrete Automation, supported by the ABB Ability\u0099 digital platform. ABB\u0092s Power Grids business will be divested to Hitachi in 2020. ABB operates in more than 100 countries with about 144,000 employees. *Operational EBITA Operational earnings before interest, taxes and acquisition-related amortization (Operational EBITA) represents Income from operations excluding: \u0095 acquisition-related amortization (as defined below), \u0095 restructuring, related and implementation costs, \u0095 changes in the amount recorded for obligations related to divested businesses occurring after the divestment date (changes in obligations related to divested businesses), \u0095 changes in estimates relating to opening balance sheets of acquired businesses (changes in pre-acquisition estimates), \u0095 gains and losses from sale of businesses (including fair value adjustment on assets and liabilities held for sale), \u0095 acquisition- and divestment-related expenses and integration costs, \u0095 certain other non-operational items, as well as \u0095 foreign exchange/commodity timing differences in income from operations consisting of: (a) unrealized gains and losses on derivatives (foreign exchange, commodities, embedded derivatives), (b) realized gains and losses on derivatives where the underlying hedged transaction has not yet been realized, and (c) unrealized foreign exchange movements on receivables/payables (and related assets/liabilities). Certain other non-operational items generally include certain regulatory, compliance and legal costs, certain asset write downs/impairments as well as other items which are determined by management on a case-by-case basis. Full year orders grew by 4%, revenue by 9% and PAT by 39% (excluding exceptional items) Resilient and diversified business model supports performance Solid cash generation continues Board recommends full-year dividend of 240% per share Q4 2019 HIGHLIGHTS Base order growth across all continuing business lines Steady revenue levels in a cautious business environment Successful achievement of legal milestones in Power Grids demerger process One-time exceptional impairment cost for the solar inverter business as per the accounting standards \u0093We have delivered another year of sustainable growth in 2019, carving out new opportunities while market volatility persists,\u0094 said Sanjeev Sharma, Managing Director, ABB India. \u00932019 has been a year of transformation for ABB, which has been managed seamlessly while delivering value to stakeholders every quarter. Each of our businesses have over the years built a strong foundation to be able to withstand any temporary headwinds whilst delivering operational and financial excellence. Balancing export with domestic focus, enhancing volumes with better pricing management and a keen eye on costs and cash helped drive performance during the year,\u0094 he added. \u0093With stimulus driven growth likely to continue, we are well primed for next level growth opportunities from sectors like transportation, infrastructure \u0096 buildings, ports, electronics, water, F&B and logistics with tier 2 and 3 cities leading the way.\u0094 KEY FIGURES On December 17, 2018, ABB announced an agreed sale of its Power Grids business. Consequently, the results of the Power Grids business are presented as discontinued operations. The company\u0092s results for all periods have been adjusted accordingly. INR Crores (for continuing business without Power Grid) CY 2019 CY2018 Q4 2019 Q42018 Orders 6970 6729 1596 1899 Revenues 7315 6690 1953 1966 Profit before exceptional and tax 514 395 150 202 Profit before exceptional and tax % 7.0 5.9 7.7 10.3 Exceptional item 70 - 70 - Profit after tax 302 254 65 129 Profit after tax % 4.1 3.8 3.4 6.5 Operational EBITA* 497 377 109 187 Operational EBITA% 6.8 5.6 5.6 9.5 Orders Total orders were at INR 1596 crore during the quarter and for CY 2019 orders were at INR 6970 crore. Despite countering market headwinds, Robotics and Discrete Automation and Industrial Automation both posted double digit growth in orders of 31% and 13% respectively Y-on-Y. Motion business had a high base given one-time large order in Q4 2018 whileQ4 2019 had witnessed some order deferments to subsequent periods. Industrial Automation was able to maintain momentum from early engagement with steel customers for precision measurement solutions, focus on gas distribution and transportation, water automation segment and securing a good market share for propulsion products. Robotics and Discrete Automation which has been a long-term player in the Indian market has been impacted by the slowdown in the auto sector. However, in Q4, with consistent customer engagement and proven offerings, it has witnessed positive traction in the paint automation segment. Electrification orders for smart products from steel major and leading manufacturers of industrial equipment marked the quarter. While the buildings solution business also registered growth this quarter, led by orders from the hospitality and the residential sectors, orders from solar segment faced headwinds. The order backlog is at INR 4123 crore, which provides revenue visibility in shorter business cycles and allows us to capitalize on market developments in the coming quarters. Revenue and operations The fourth quarter revenue was INR 1,953 crore and at INR 7,315 crore for CY 2019. The quarter witnessed uptrend in revenues from projects for systems drives. Distribution solutions was a growth driver for revenue with improved execution. Robotics and Discrete Automation successfully steered applications to deployment in non-automotive sectors like consumer electronics and food and beverage. The year was marked by the launch of market leading products like Emax2 digital circuit-breaker and IVIE switches which transformed industrial operations and living spaces into connected and intelligent versions, ultra-low harmonic drives, and IE4 motors Profit and cash flow from operating activities The Company reported a profit before exceptional item and tax (PBT) of INR 150 crore and profit after tax (PAT) of INR 65 crore for the quarter. In CY2019, PBT before exceptional item was at INR 514 crore and PAT at INR 302 crore for the company. During the quarter, the Company in accordance to the accounting standards, recorded an exceptional impairment cost amounting to INR 69.70 crore towards the remeasurement of solar inverter business\u0092s fixed assets and inventories at realizable values. Despite the liquidity crunch in the market, the Company improved collections and reported a cash position of ~INR 1595 crore as on December 31, 2019. Dividend Based on the business performance and the potential in current markets despite the PG carve out impact, the Board of Directors maintained the dividend trend and recommended a dividend of Rs 4.80 per share (240 percent), subject to the approval of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Demerger and NCLT approval During the quarter, ABB India received the NCLT approval and the Power Grids entity was successfully demerged from ABB India on Dec 1, 2019. The new entity ABB Power Products and Systems India Limited (APPSIL) is now operational as a self-sufficient unit with minimal support from ABB India. Asset separation is currently in progress. Outlook Stimulus led growth with structural and economic reforms expected to pave way for growth pickup. ABB India will continue to watch market developments closely in the near term and be ready to capitalize on opportunities that may arise. By leveraging a solid foundation built over similar market conditions in the last few years, the Company will pursue prospects, innovating and expanding to counter volatilities and headwinds in the short to medium term. On a longer-term basis, the structural growth drivers and stimulus measures are likely to usher in some stability for the wider economy subject to global easing.

In a quarter, marked by a national lockdown, customer trust in ABB was reinforced by increased orders despite the divestment of the solar inverter portfolio at the end of February. Virtual pitches to customers, non-system product packaging, remote services and remote troubleshooting are just some of the channels deployed in a COVID-19-impacted business environment. Postponement of major capex to subsequent quarters due to COVID-19 has also led to greater focus on plant upkeep and optimization resulting in opening new frontiers in the digital service business. During the quarter, key orders received include: Order from Indian Railways for propulsion equipment and converters Order for wind turbine generators and energy efficiency drives for the energy sector Order for developing and implementing a custom SCADA-based solution that controls and monitors gas flow in tea estates spread across a northeastern state Flue Gas Desulphurization project orders Order for analyzer systems for a green-field project in the pulp & paper sector Low voltage switchgear and busbar orders for electrical major ABB India\u0092s order backlog as of March 31, 2020 stood at INR 4,444 crore, higher than earlier, and this provides some revenue visibility in the coming quarters. The company shall exercise caution to ensure that conversion value chain is completed in all aspects. Revenue and operations Revenues for the first quarter stood at INR 1,522 crore, impacted by lower sales, non-receipt of delivery clearance, lower service revenue in the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This impact primarily occurred in the month of March 2020. Despite many activities coming to a standstill in March, the quarter was marked by commissioning for a mining major in Raigarh, electrical and automation systems for a cement major and port and electrics, drives and automation for a leading mill in Bangladesh. Terminal installation and commissioning for LPG, power management Electrical Control System (ECS) for a leading refinery, and commissioning of two units of a power plant in Kerala are some of the other projects where ABB\u0092s involvement ensured continuity and safe operations. Profit and cash flow from operating activities The Company reported a profit before tax (PBT) of INR 87 crore and profit after tax (PAT) of INR 66 crore during the first quarter due to lower volumes including service revenue and unfavorable mix. Resultant under-absorption and mark to market (MTM) impact due to forex volatility was partly offset by refund incomes and one-time gain on sale of solar business during the quarter. The Company continued to maintain a stable cash position of INR 1464 crore as on March 31, 2020, in a market where cash collection continues to be a challenge. COVID-19 response ABB\u0092s primary focus is on securing the health and safety of our employees while maintaining business continuity. ABB is constantly monitoring the evolving situation and taking all necessary precautions in line with local government and WHO guidelines. With the COVID-19 pandemic ongoing, ABB is working constantly with customers and partners to maintain the supply of goods and services. As part of this response, ABB is maximizing use of remote service tools and ABB Ability\u0099 digital solutions, including free remote services. Where possible, the company is adjusting resources to meet the anticipated slow-down in demand and eliminating non-essential costs. ABB is also helping maintain continuity, de-risking operations with remote technologies for acceptance tests, commissioning and maintenance, supplying critical equipment and helping customers transition to seamless ramp up for emergency supply for the pandemic. Short term outlook The global economy is expected to contract in 2020 after a rapid deterioration in outlook driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite unprecedented stimuli by governments and central banks around the world and initial signs of recovering economic activity in China, macro-indicators point to a global recession of uncertain duration, as many countries, continue to face restrictions with anticipated long-term economic consequences. The impact of COVID-19, as well as the fall in oil prices, has significantly impacted the short-term outlook. While the company is taking prompt action to adapt its operations and cost base to safeguard profitability, it expects the results in the coming quarter to be impacted due to the loss of volumes. Despite short-term disruptions, ABB is confident in the underlying resilience of its businesses and operating model. The company has a strong balance sheet and is confident that its liquidity needs will be well covered. ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries. With a history of innovation spanning more than 130 years, ABB has four, customer-focused, globally leading businesses: Electrification, Industrial Automation, Motion, and Robotics & Discrete Automation, supported by the ABB Ability\u0099 digital platform.

With the COVID-19 pandemic ongoing, ABB is working constantly with customers and partners to maintain the supply of goods and services. As part of this response, ABB is maximizing use of remote service tools and ABB Ability\u0099 digital solutions, including free remote services. Where possible, the company is adjusting resources to meet the anticipated slow-down in demand and eliminating non-essential costs. ABB is also helping maintain continuity, de-risking operations with remote technologies for acceptance tests, commissioning and maintenance, supplying critical equipment and helping customers transition to seamless ramp up for emergency supply for the pandemic. Short term outlook The global economy is expected to contract in 2020 after a rapid deterioration in outlook driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite unprecedented stimuli by governments and central banks around the world and initial signs of recovering economic activity in China, macro-indicators point to a global recession of uncertain duration, as many countries, continue to face restrictions with anticipated long-term economic consequences. The impact of COVID-19, as well as the fall in oil prices, has significantly impacted the short-term outlook. While the company is taking prompt action to adapt its operations and cost base to safeguard profitability, it expects the results in the coming quarter to be impacted due to the loss of volumes. Despite short-term disruptions, ABB is confident in the underlying resilience of its businesses and operating model. The company has a strong balance sheet and is confident that its liquidity needs will be well covered. ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries. With a history of innovation spanning more than 130 years, ABB has four, customer-focused, globally leading businesses: Electrification, Industrial Automation, Motion, and Robotics & Discrete Automation, supported by the ABB Ability\u0099 digital platform. ABB\u0092s Power Grids business will be divested to Hitachi in 2020. ABB operates in more than 100 countries with about 144,000 employees. www.abb.com/in \u0097 *Operational EBITA margin Operational EBITA margin is Operational EBITA as a percentage of Operational revenues. Operational EBITA is Operational earnings before interest, taxes and acquisition-related amortization (Operational EBITA) represents Income from operation excluding: \u0095 acquisition-related amortization (as defined below), \u0095 restructuring, related and implementation costs, \u0095 changes in the amount recorded for obligations related to divested businesses occurring after the divestment date (changes in obligations related to divested businesses), \u0095 changes in estimates relating to opening balance sheets of acquired businesses (changes in pre-acquisition estimates), \u0095 gains and losses from sale of businesses, \u0095 acquisition- and divestment-related expenses and integration costs, \u0095 certain other non-operational items, as well as \u0095 foreign exchange/commodity timing differences in income from operations consisting of: (a) unrealized gains and losses on derivatives (foreign exchange, commodities, embedded derivatives), (b) realized gains and losses on derivatives where the underlying hedged transaction has not yet been realized, and (c) unrealized foreign exchange movements on receivables/payables (and related assets/liabilities). Certain other non-operational items generally includes: certain regulatory, compliance and legal costs, certain asset write downs/impairments as well as other items which are determined by management on a case-by-case basis.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB India Ltd\u0092s stock, which had a volatile trajectory in 2019, is now close to its 52-week low with investors seemingly tired waiting for the fruits of restructuring. It is more than a year since the capital goods company\u0092s Swiss-Swedish parent exited the low-margin and low-growth power grids business at the global level. On home ground, the power grids business was beleaguered with weak ordering, weak profit margins and huge working capital needs, all of which took a toll on its profitability. In July, the parent firm even exited the solar business. Yet, ABB India continues to spring unpleasant surprises. After it raised hopes of improvement in profitability in the last three consecutive quarters, the December quarter (Q4 CY19) performance came as a bolt from the blue. Revenue growth was flat year-on-year (y-o-y) and Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) sank by 36%. Subdued revenue and weak operating leverage took a toll on profitability. As a result, Ebitda margin contracted by about 400 basis points to 7.1%. Graphic by Santosh Sharma/Mint What went wrong? This time, the clean-up act was in the industrial automation segment. A 20% y-o-y drop in the segment\u0092s revenue dragged Ebit margin down from 14.1% to 0.2%. Margins were adversely affected because of losses and provisions made on legacy projects. \u0093For the full year 2019, the segment\u0092s Ebit margin dipped to 6.2% versus 10.5-12.3% over the past four years, on costs related to legacy orders,\"\" said a Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd report. The management did not quantify provisions made on orders in the segment, but it did say that potential losses on projects have been covered. \u0093While this is unlikely to be repeated in CY20, we have treated it as a business loss and not considered it a one-off for CY20,\"\" said a report by Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. The other segments such as discrete automation, robotics and motion, and electrification products, put up a decent show. Also, ABB India\u0092s business is closely linked to capital expenditure and is thus bearing the brunt of the slowdown. Order flow was down 15% in the quarter, while the overall order book of ?4,123 crore is barely 0.6 time its annual revenue. Solace comes from the fact that the Indian entity is being nurtured as an export hub by its parent. Hence, global recovery should be a strong tailwind for revenue traction even for ABB India.

{"_news_text": "\"Mr. Parikshit D Kandpal, Institutional Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. ABB India (Annual Report Analysis): Headwinds remain Key takeaways from ABB's CY20 AR are as follows: (1) The share of exports in the revenue has grown from 11% to 18% over CY17-19; (2) Switchgear/Electrical Control, Supply/Motors, and other machines delivered robust CY17-19 revenue CAGR of 14/19/34% and contributed 31/24/19% to CY19 revenue (cumulative revenue mix of 74%); (3) net cash status of Rs 16bn. With clients conserving capital and global growth outlook bleak, new capex/opex headwinds remain. ABB's performance is highly sensitive to demand outlook. A challenging 2QCY20 with slow ramp-up in revenue will limit further re-rating. We believe headwinds are not fully priced into current rich valuations (51.3x Mar-22E EPS). Maintain SELL with TP of Rs 755/sh. Composition of product and business segments: while ABB's product segments can be broadly categorized into (1) Switchgear, (2) Motors & Generators, (3) Drives & Electronics, and (4) Services, its business segments are centered around solutions provided to customers: (1) Motion, (2) Robotics, (3) Electrification and (4) Industrial Automation (IA). Electrification and Motion constitute ~75% of revenue and bulk of the profitability. Robotics remains small, as of now, and IA is suffering from high under-absorption, apart from a few legacy lower margin infrastructure and power projects, due to sluggish rate of growth in investments in greenfield refinery, thermal power and petrochemical domain. Consolidation in the steel market and slowdown in the auto sector have impacted CAPEX additions and production. Power Grids (PG) demerger and Solar inverter business sale: During the year, PG business was demerged to APPSIL and listed separately. PG offered HV products and solutions across the generation, T&D value chain apart from railways and EV charging. This was part of a global deal to sell the PG business to Hitachi. With this cyclical chunky project-based business now hived off, ABB is a pure-play product and value-add services-based entity with short cycle orders. Sale of Solar Inverters business (7-8% of revenues, thin margins, 50:50 domestic: exports) will also be margin accretive. While exports continue to drive growth, prime focus to be on domestic markets: Exports contributed 18% to CY19 revenue (13/11% in CY18/17). ABB registered double-digit growth for the third year in exports, embarking on a journey of \"\"Make in India for the World\"\". With capacity expansion not being a constraint as land is available, focus is firstly on domestic business stabilization and profitability, bringing quality to international standards, and then going in for export-driven growth. So, exports would remain ~20% of revenue. Key growth drivers: ABB stands to benefit from impetus given to railways electrification; MRTS construction is planned over 26 cities; gas & water distribution infra opportunities would emerge in the Smart Cities Mission (AMRUT). While capex remains elusive, increasing digitization across core industries like cement, metal/mining, marine, oil & gas, etc., and deeper tier-2/3 cities' penetration will lead the next leg of growth. Digitisation opportunities would emerge in process industries, pharma, F&B, and data centers.

{"_news_text": "\"Hitachi to tap ABB power grid clients for renewable energy business Newly named Hitachi ABB Power Grids will operate as a joint venture out of Switzerland 8 Jul 2020 | Michael Marray THE long-planned acquisition of Swiss engineering group ABB's power grids division by Hitachi has finally closed. The transaction involves Hitachi acquiring an 80.1% stake in the new power grids unit, with the price tag valuing the company at US$11 billion. The newly named Hitachi ABB Power Grids, though controlled by Hitachi, will operate as a joint venture with its headquarters remaining in Switzerland. The company has 36,000 employees, operations in 90 countries, and annual revenues of around US$10 billion. ABB has the option to dispose of its 19.9% stake after three years at fair market value - though with a floor price set at 90% of the US$11 billion enterprise value figure. Hitachi has previously said that it would like to make the company a wholly-owned subsidiary three years after closing. The deal was originally announced in December 2018, but the process of ABB spinning off its power grids division, plus obtaining clearances relating to competition laws, meant that the timeline was originally set out to take around eighteen months. The ABB Power Grids business engages in providing systems, software, products, and service solutions. The offerings are mainly used by the company\u0092s infrastructure, industry, utility, and transport customers. The business is spread across Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. The deal offers Hitachi access to new markets, and will help with the global expansion of its power grid industry activities. A presentation to investors by Hitachi says that the acquisition will help secure a global customer base and build an energy platform to realize the energy solutions business which Hitachi aims to expand. It plans to leverage the global customer base of ABB\u0092s power grids business across Hitachi\u0092s all business areas beyond the energy solutions business, and build an energy platform by combining global No.1 power grids business with Hitachi\u0092s digital technology. The two companies had already been cooperating since 2015 via the Hitachi ABB HVDC Technologies partnership. ABB businesses include grid automation software, grid integration via substations and HVDC, high voltage products and transformers.

{"_news_text": "\"B&R, ABB\u0092s business unit, is integrating ABB robots in its own automation portfolio. This will enable B&R to supply machine builders who want to buy directly from them along with their control, I/O, and drive components. Integrating robotics and automation together means only one controller and engineering system is needed for development, diagnostics, and maintenance. This eliminates the need for extra control cabinets, ultimately saving floor space. \u0093The integration of ABB\u0092s robot fleet into the B&R portfolio makes us a true one-stop-shop,\u0094 says Sami Atiya, President of ABB\u0092s Robotics and Discrete Automation business. \u0093We are the only company to offer industrial automation customers the entire range of integrated hardware and software solutions around control, actuation, robotics, sensing and analytics and electrification. Our strength lies in our ability to combine ABB and B&R products into one solution, supported by our deep application expertise. This will help manufacturers increase their flexibility, at all levels including machines, to support shorter product cycles and to make much smaller lots of greater variety.\u0094 Because the robot no longer needs a dedicated controller, interfaces between the machine and the robot are eliminated. Axes and sensors communicate through a common network, increasing precision and efficiency. This creates quicker synchronization between the robot and machine components. The robot\u0092s and the machine\u0092s motion control axes can be easily coordinated, allowing for better productivity and output. The two companies gave this sample scenario: \u0093The result of a quality inspection with a B&R vision camera can be converted into a control command for the ABB robot in less than a millisecond, so defective workpieces can be removed from the production process without manual intervention or slowing the manufacturing process.\u0094 Combining robotics with machine control also makes way for user-friendly programming. Machine builders can make use of only one application and development environment instead of the traditional approach wherein programming a robotics application and machine application happens in separate development environments. Additionally, ready-made software components of map technology are available which will allow even those without knowledge of special robotics languages to easily set up and configure machine applications. These are expected to reduce development times overtime. \u0093Our newly developed integrated solution enables us to support machine builders, enhancing their processes and future-proofing their automation investments,\u0094 says Hans Wimmer, Managing Director of B&R. \u0093Traditionally, the robot is a self-contained system, with its own controller and its own control cabinet. Engineering, diagnostics and maintenance are all performed using dedicated systems, and with specific robotics language, you often need a specialist programmer.

{"_news_text": "\"Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (Freshfields) has continued its successful defence of ABB in respect of a claim brought by BritNed Development Limited (BritNed), the operator of the UK-Netherlands electricity interconnector cable, arising out of ABBs participation in historic cartel conduct in the power cables sector. Following a three-day hearing in July this year, the Court of Appeal dismissed BritNeds seven grounds of appeal seeking further damages from ABB and allowed ABBs cross-appeal, thereby requiring BritNed to pay back almost half of the 15m damages it was awarded at trial, against its initial claim for over 200m. The Court of Appeal also refused BritNeds request for permission to appeal. In the first UK appeal court judgment in a cartel follow-on damages claim, Lady Justice Asplin, Lord Justice Henderson and Lord Justice Patten today unanimously held that, contrary to BritNeds submissions, it was open to the trial judge in the case to conclude, having conducted a detailed assessment of the evidence in the case, that there was no deliberate overcharge in the price paid to ABB by BritNed for the interconnector. The Court of Appeal emphasised that claimants in cartel damages claims must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the price they actually paid was too high, and that the same fundamental principles of proving loss apply in cartel damages claims as in other types of damages action. In respect of ABBs appeal against the award of damages in respect of so-called cartel savings, the Court of Appeal allowed ABBs appeal and held that the award of damages on the basis of savings made by ABB rather than a loss suffered by BritNed was based on an error of law and must be set aside. Freshfields partner Mark Sansom commented: We welcome the Court of Appeals well-considered judgment, which provides authoritative clarity that the standard for claimants to prove entitlement to competition damages should not be lower than in other types of damages claims. The judgment also reinforces that damages cannot be awarded where loss has not been proven. The clear guidance provided by the Court of Appeal will inevitably, and rightly, influence future competition damages claims. The team representing ABB was instructed by Dominique Speekenbrink, Senior Vice President, Head Antitrust Practice Group, ABB and comprised a counsel team of Mark Hoskins QC, Sarah Ford QC, Jennifer MacLeod and Jon Lawrence, all of Brick Court Chambers. The Freshfields competition litigation team was led by partners Mark Sansom and Nick Frey, assisted by senior associate Lara Hall and associates Natalie Puddicombe, Ramya Arnold, George Lumbers and Sophie Tang.

{"_news_text": "\"Ashok Leyland, the flagship of the Hinduja Group, and ABB Power Grids have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to expand the e-mobility ecosystem in the country by providing environment-friendly electric buses in India. The partnership will work on the development of a pilot electric bus based on ABB\u0092s flash charge technology \u0091TOSA\u0092, which charges the battery in a short time as passengers get on and off the bus. The company says that this new technology cuts the hassle of taking the bus to the charging station every few hours for charging or having a replacement bus ready, cutting down on the size of the fleet and, at the same time increasing passenger-carrying capacity. Speaking on the partnership, N Venu, managing director, ABB Power Products and Systems, said, \u0093We are pushing the boundaries of e-mobility with our flash-charging technology TOSA for buses to contribute to a cleaner, greener, and sustainable future. The aim is to provide a zero local emission mass public transportation bus system with high passenger capacity. We are pleased to be working with Ashok Leyland in advancing responsible urban mobility.\u0094 The Indian government is pushing hard to promote the use of electric vehicles in the country and is planning to reach 30% penetration by 2030. The main challenge for players in the electric bus segment is to maximize passenger load carrying capacity and at the same time, increase the running time, making the whole operation economically viable. ABB\u0092s technology TOSA lets cities cut down on the pollution levels without affecting passenger capacity or journey times. With the help of this new technology at selected stops, the buses can be charged with a 600 kW power boost within 15 seconds, and a further few minutes of charging at the bus terminal enables a full recharge without hampering the bus schedule. This innovation has been claimed to save as much as 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide on a line covering 600,000 kilometers per year. Under the MoU, ABB Power Grid will be responsible for the planning, design, and installation of TOSA charging systems in the country, whereas, Ashok Leyland will be responsible for developing buses compatible with the TOSA technology. In October last year, to facilitate the usage of EVs in the country, the Union Power Minister R.K. Singh approved the amendments in electric vehicle charging guidelines and specifications. To increase electric mobility in the country, the government reduced the applicable rate of Goods and Services Tax on electric vehicles. The 36th GST Council meeting, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, decided that the GST rate on all the electric vehicles be reduced from 12% to 5%. The council also decided that the hiring of electric buses (carrying capacity more than 12 passengers) by local authorities will be exempted from GST.

{"_news_text": "\"When former British Prime Minister, Teresa May, proclaimed that she wasn\u0092t opposed to scraping off mold from the top of a jar of jam and eating the product underneath, it sparked a conversation about what mouldy foods were safe to eat. Here, group vice president food & beverage at ABB, Darcy Simonis, looks at the advancing methods food producers are using to monitor the safety of their products. On the whole, eating mouldy food is not an advisable practice \u0096 mould is the scourge of the food industry with producers striving to deliver the freshest produce possible to their customers. However, the world of technology is rapidly advancing, with applications making their way into all areas of food production, which is helping manufacturers to combat unnecessary food spoilage and waste. In an industry where the demands of the customer are ever evolving, it is hard for food manufacturers to keep up with the latest trends. This is where data analytics can come into play, giving a level of insight that is invaluable. The use of data analytics in marketing and customer insight is well known, but its uses can go far wider, helping food producers to keep their products at the pinnacle of quality and freshness. Over the course of time, the quality and the characteristics of a product can change. Yet, by using integrated data analytics, manufacturers can learn more about the factors that affect the shelf life of their products. This information can then be used to adapt the product or process to increase shelf life, potentially saving the manufacturer money and time, as well as reducing food waste. Data analytics also has its uses when maintaining and improving the quality of a consumable product. For instance, during the beer brewing process, monitoring alcohol levels is critical and is something that is regularly analyzed. However, it is a time-consuming process and can be disruptive to the production line. As a result, there are new methods coming into play that allow testing to be carried out without disrupting production and data analytics is being used to measure whether these methods are as insightful and effective as the traditional wet chemistry method. Monitoring and analysis in the food safety and beverage industry is vital \u0097 customers demand that their favorite product tastes the same no matter where they are in the world or where it was manufactured or packaged. The process requires strict control and repeatable standard solutions that can be rolled out across multiple production sites. Manufacturing Execution System (MES) services from ABB comprise of a wide portfolio of visibility and transparency of the complete end-to-end process, from incoming raw materials to the finished shipped product.

With this new feature, the company states that users will be able to program ABB robots to begin additive manufacturing production in 30 minutes. Available as an add-on in its RobotStudio software, ABB aims to eliminate manual programming for its customers with the new 3D printing software, in order to enable faster prototype production. \u0093With our new 3D Printing software, we are offering customers a faster and more streamlined 3D printing process,\u0094 states Steven Wyatt, Head of Portfolio and Digital at ABB Robotics and Discrete Automation. \u0093COUPLED WITH THE HIGH PERFORMANCE OF OUR ROBOTS, THIS MEANS MANUFACTURERS CAN NOW PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY 3D PRINTED OBJECTS FOR A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS MORE EFFICIENTLY.\u0094 The usage of ABB robotic arms in the 3D printing industry Headquartered in Zurich, ABB is a major technology corporation operating mainly in robotics, power, heavy electrical equipment, and automation technology areas, carried out through its various divisions. A global Fortune 500 company, ABB operates in more than 100 countries with about 147,000 employees. ABB Robotics a division of the company that manufactures robots, and supplies robot software, peripheral equipment, process equipment, modular manufacturing cells and services. Its robots are used for tasks such as welding, material handling, small parts assembly, painting & finishing and more. Key markets for the robots include automotive, plastics, metal fabrication, foundry, solar and consumer electronics. ABB\u0092s robotic equipment has seen various applications within the 3D printing sphere. Robotic Additive Manufacturing (RAM) technology developer MX3D, known for its various large-scale additive manufacturing projects, constructed its 12 meter long 3D printed steel bridge using WAAM 3D printing technology attached to ABB robotic arms. Additionally, ABB also provided UK-based infrastructural support service provider Amey with concept drawings for applying 3D printing to train-track renewal services using its robotic arms. Simplifying the robotic digital manufacturing process ABB\u0092s RobotStudio is a simulation and offline programming software that allows users to program robots on a remote PC without shutting down production. It therefore allows users to perform tasks such as training, programming, and optimization without disturbing production. The company has now integrated its new 3D printing software into RobotStudio through its PowerPac portfolio of add-ons, which also includes ArcWelding and Machining PowerPacs. The 3D printing PowerPac is designed to overcome the time consumption associated with standard 3D printing methods using machines and robots, which requires the printing paths to be programmed through plotting many points and trajectories. Instead, the 3D printing PowerPac is capable of converting standard slicer software design for ABB\u0092s simulation environment and robot code. This helps to simplify the process for operators progressing from the CAD design stage to final modeling of a product, reducing the time it can take. With the launch of its 3D printing software, ABB has provided background on the introduction of the new feature, pointing to the growth of the 3D printing industry overall: \u0093The 3D printing industry is poised for a period of strong growth, with valuation expected to hit USD 34.8 billion by 2024, owing in part to the development of new industrial-grade 3D printing materials.\u0094 Source:

{"_news_text": "\"ABB has launched ABB Ability Augmented Field procedures with an aim to drive worker safety and efficiency across the energy sector ABB Augmented Field Procedures HoloLens. (Image source: ABB) Developed specifically to meet the needs of field operators, the technology is expected to empower seamless integration between the field and the plant distributed control system offering improved safety, reducing the risk for human error and making field operations more efficient. With more than 20 per cent of industrial downtime reportedly due to human error, ABB Ability Augmented Field Procedures are set to enable consistency when executing manual procedures, standardising operating procedures and maintenance or repair techniques in the field, tightening field to control room integration and digitally recording notes to ensure operational knowledge is captured and utilised. Unlike traditional paper-based operating procedures, the technology enables interactive execution of procedures using a mobile device to guide operators through each step in a consistent, effective and safe way. \u0093Human error continues to be a significant contributing factor to safety issues, as well as production down time,\u0094 said Chris Naunheimer, digital lead, energy industries, ABB. \u0093Engineers spend considerable time using and interpreting data. With this solution, we intend to address these challenges and truly transform the future of work.\u0094 Created in collaboration with industry majors, the system can be used in any industrial environment, in greenfield and brownfield sites, for start-up, routine maintenance, and shutdown activities. The solution is an example of ABB\u0092s support of workforce management enterprise applications designed to allow workers to work anywhere and manage the system on their own. Naunheimer concluded, \u0093During these challenging times, it is more important than ever to balance worker safety with productivity.

{"_news_text": "\"Three-phase power systems are the life blood of the modern data center, but because electrical generators tend to be old, various countries\u0092 electricity standards mandate different voltage levels. There is a movement under way to adopt 380V direct current as an international standard, among other reasons, because it dissipates much less heat. But there\u0092s another benefit that\u0092s been hanging around toward the bottom of the list, up to now preceded by asterisks and words like \u0093Other\u0094 and \u0093Also,\u0094 that now begins to look like the all-time champion for buried ledes: A power system that uses far less copper \u0097 as much as 95% less \u0097 can be designed more compactly. And such a design becomes a candidate for an inexpensive form of liquid cooling, that could in turn reduce data center temperatures. That\u0092s one of the goals of an expanded partnership between Cray \u0097 now the HPC division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise \u0097 and Zurich-based power systems maker ABB. They\u0092re looking to prototype a power delivery system for supercomputers that could dramatically reduce heat emissions, while at the same time cutting expenses. And if it works for supercomputers, ABB may push for broader adoption throughout enterprise and hyperscale data centers. One possible ticket in: tying innovations in power systems design for supercomputing to advancements in cooling systems for business computing. \u0093We\u0092ve seen liquid cooling in data centers quite frequently,\u0094 remarked Peter Raadsen, product line leader for ABB\u0092s embedded power line, in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. \u0093But liquid cooling and power are a more recent wedding.\u0094 Much of the design of enterprise servers is still rooted in PC architecture, especially the 12V, 5V, and 3.3V rails that emerged from the ATX form factor. It takes higher amperage to funnel lower voltages, and that\u0092s where the energy loss from resistance comes from. The move toward 48V DC racks has been driven by a need to prioritize energy efficiency and copper conservation over low-cost manufacturing. But 48V DC turned out to be a handicap for supercomputing. That side of the industry was accustomed to power delivery of 600V AC and 480V AC, stepped down to 208V AC or 120V AC. A rectifier would then convert that power to DC for battery storage, then back to AC for distribution throughout facilities, and then back to DC again for routing to PDUs. In 2006, Lawrence Livermore Labs launched a study into whether it would just be better to distribute DC power straight from the delivery system to the server racks. LLNL concluded, with the equipment available at the time, that a theoretical efficiency improvement of at least 28% was feasible, if that delivery methodology was applied to 2008 data centers. The voltage level LLNL chose was 380V DC. \u0093When you have a supercomputer, which is the ultimate gas guzzler,\u0094 Raadsen said, \u0093you definitely want to look at ways to get that power from the front end down into the innards in the most effective way. Increasing current over the power distribution is not going to work, because the amount of copper necessary is going to be excessive. The only way to go is to raise the voltage.\u0094 Yet that high voltage presents several, shall we say, challenges for operators. \u0093If you touch 380V,\u0094 said Raadsen, \u0093it\u0092s an event you may remember afterwards.\u0094 Now, ABB is advocating a +/- 190V DC solution. \u0093What it means is that, if you\u0092re an earthed person and you touch any of the two wires, you\u0092re receiving 190V,\"\" he explained, \"\"which is still a relatively safe voltage. Not as safe as low voltage, which is below 60V, but it\u0092s relatively safe.\u0094 The delta between the two feeds still add up to 380V, enabling systems to be powered with 380V while cutting personal risk by half. ABB\u0092s and HPE\u0092s just published case study claims that their dual-polarity voltage factor is capable of reducing the amount of copper involved in power delivery by a factor of 14, over a delivery system based on PC-derived architecture. Heat dissipation goes down, electricity lossage is dramatically reduced, and both production and delivery costs are slashed. And as PDUs become smaller, they become easier to cool over a given area of space. Stage one in the evolution of liquid-cooled power, Raadsen suggested, involves affixing a PDU to a liquid-cooled cold plate, which is a very common method with respect to cooling processors and data storage devices. The next stage, however, would be extraordinary: equipping PDUs with built-in liquid cooling circuits. \u0093This allows to unplug a power supply and re-plug another supply, without having to reach for your bag of screwdrivers and undo the entire power supply,\u0094 he told us. In other words, not only would such a design be liquid-cooled, but also hot-swappable, invoking design elements from the world of telephone data equipment, whose power components have been hot-swappable for some time. Andre Schaerer, ABB\u0092s vice president of digital partnerships, told Data Center Knowledge to expect a joint announcement with HPE regarding power for smart sensor-equipped manufacturing equipment,

{"_news_text": "\"ABB has secured a \u0080157 million contract to supply power, propulsion and digital solutions for Genting Hong Kong\u0092s six \u0091Universal Class\u0092 vessels that will bring global hotel brands to sea The new vessels will be designed to the highest safety and environmental standards and will be powered by ABB\u0092s Azipod\u00ae electric propulsion, which has become the cruise industry standard since its launch in 1990. Each of the 286-meter vessels will be propelled by twin Azipod\u00ae units, with a combined power of 30 MW (40,230 HP) and will run on low-emission liquified natural gas. The vessels will be built by the Genting-owned shipbuilding company MV Werften with sites in Wismar, Rostoch and Stralsund in Germany. The vessels are due for delivery in 2023-2024. The six vessels will bring luxury cruising experiences to its guests and feature high-end amenities, and will have a passenger capacity of 1000 to 4000 passengers depending on the Luxury, Premium or Contemporary class. Each cruise ship will have a total of 15 decks. Genting will operate these vessels for global hotel brands that want to enter the marine industry but are facing constraints related to most shipbuilding slots being occupied at present. The vessels will have the capability to be connected to ABB Ability\u0099 Collaborative Operations Center infrastructure, which monitors the performance of ABB technology on board and remotely connects operators with ABB experts. \u0093These vessels represent the next generation of cruising with their high flexibility, sustainable profile and highest safety and efficiency standards. ABB\u0092s Azipod\u00ae electric propulsion, known for its unparalleled performance, environmental credentials and reliability, has been a natural choice for these vessels,\u0094 said Gustaf Gronberg, Executive Vice President, Marine Operations & Newbuilding, Genting Hong Kong. \u0093With these vessels, we enter a new era of sustainable cruising, and we are pleased to collaborate with ABB, who through the years have proven to be a reliable solution provider enabling us to deploy advanced technology that defines the future of cruising,\u0094 said Peter Fetten, President and CEO of MV Werften. \u0093Sustainable technologies are at the heart of what we do at ABB, and we are truly honored to continue our long-standing relationship with MV Werften and Genting to see our technology chosen for these ships that seek to redefine modern-day cruising,\u0094 said Peter Terwiesch, President of the Industrial Automation business at ABB, which offers solutions for a wide range of industries, including marine. Cruise travelling is becoming more popular for holidaymakers and according to industry body Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), 30 million passengers are expected to cruise the seas in 2019 \u0096 a 6% increase year-on-year.

{"_news_text": "\"The automotive industry operates in a constantly evolving environment that is governed by increasingly stringent regulations, shifting mobility trends and a growing demand for more customised vehicles. Automakers are adapting to these changes by building a complex network of production solutions that are both complex, involving many ancillary facilities across the world; and flexible, so as to quickly respond to new demands and challenges. This complexity in manufacturing has increased the need for automakers to find new ways to rein in costs and achieve consistency through precise engineering and rapid quality inspection. The rationale is simple. The ability to manufacture consistently high-quality products has a direct bearing on everything from the costs incurred during manufacturing to the time taken for a company to successfully bring its product to the market. In order to achieve this, ABB has developed a robotic 3D vision and metrology (3DVM) system, which is the latest quality inspection solution that provides fast, automated and accurate metrology testing to dramatically speed up production and help manufacturers build more efficient processes, reduce costly rework and lessen scrappage. The system The 3DVM system is an integrated solution that combines an industrial robot mounted with ABB\u0092s 3D optical scanner that inspects quality based on geometrical measurements. \u0093The system is capable of detecting defects less than half the width of a human hair, and those that are imperceptible to the naked eye. This eliminates the need for time consuming manual inspections, while also significantly reducing the likelihood of faults and errors,\u0094 said Toni Roda, ABB\u0092s Global Product Manager for Vision. The 3DVM system can be used on both off-line and in-line testing stations and uses a single 3D camera, which eliminates the possibility of views overlapping while reducing hardware failures. The system is immune to vibrations and variations in ambient conditions due to its photogrammetric self-compensation and can detect anomalies at 20 microns. Adjustable light power provides accurate results regardless of light conditions, while the system can also differentiate between shiny and black surfaces without the need for spray. ABB also offers a complete 3D robot inspection cell made up of a robot and a rotating table on which the manufactured part is placed, either manually or with the help of another robot. The scanning robot and the table move in a coordinated manner for the robot to capture images from multiple angles in real-time. The contact-less inspection enables the same system to inspect everything from the fuel tank to the fender skirt and even completely assembled car bodies. All that needs to be changed is for the robot to adjust the reach of its arm. How it works The 3DVM system uses structured light technology and the principles of photogrammetry to capture images of the manufactured product. The optoprojector is fitted on the robotic arm, which moves around the product projecting light to capture images from multiple angles, while the optical scanner scans the product and generates, a detailed, virtual three-dimensional model of the part for inspection in real-time. The movement of the robot\u0092s arm is automatically programmed on Sidio planner, a plug-in on ABB\u0092s offline programming software, RobotStudio. ABB has simplified robot programming by enabling operators to easily instruct the robot on what points of the part that need to be checked. The system calculates the best path for the robot\u0092s arm and executes the movement. >> ABB online magazine: Digital robotics solutions for the automotive industry Once the 3D model is projected on the screen, the software compares it to a master file and automatically highlights areas where the manufactured part deviates from the master file beyond the threshold set by the operator. The 3D model of the part can be rotated completely for the operator to check for anomalies, allowing manufacturers to take corrective measures without having to disrupt the entire production line. Operators can conduct a series of analysis, for example, test the position and diameter of holes on an automotive part or even define the acceptable levels of spatter on welded parts. The benefits: Speed The 3DVM robot quality inspection system offers a host of advantages over previously use machine and manual inspection methods, of which speed of inspection is a game changer. Traditionally, automotive manufacturers use coordinated-measuring machines (CMM), fitted on a linear axis. The CMMs work by touching the manufactured part at multiple points to generate a digital 3D model. This contact-based measuring technique not only takes nearly eight hours to completely inspect the part, but also offers only a limited number of inspection points. On the other hand, the 3DVM system which projects light patterns and captures images, does not come into contact with the manufactured part, allowing it to complete the inspection within 3-4 minutes. Moreover, the 3D optical scanner is able to capture about 5 million points for inspection, nearly 2 million more than traditional CMM systems. The ability to speed up quality inspection using more information allows companies to avoid unnecessary and costly scrappage and rework of parts. The high-speed inspection allows companies to conduct quality control on many more parts than traditional CMM systems. So in the case of a faulty part, instead of scrapping the entire batch due to the lack of time for further inspection, operators can quickly conduct more checks and reduce the rate of scrappage. Easy automation Unlike traditional metrology processes that are housed in laboratories or built on linear axis at a dedicated spot of the factory floor, the 3D robot quality inspection system by ABB is a modular solution that can be installed in the production area or where quality analysis needs to take place. This reduces the logistics needed to move parts around the factory floor and also cuts down on costs related to building a lab premises. All the programming of the robot can be done offline on RobotStudio and sent to the single logic controller that controls the entire robot inspection setup. This enables the system to work automatically, with minimal or no human intervention for a task that is arduous and repetitive. This feature not only saves time, but also frees up human operators to perform more rewarding work. A touch screen provides an intuitive interface for operations, while employees need only two days of training to handle and control the full operation of the unit. The future of quality inspection The use of the 3D optical scanner automatically digitalises the quality inspection and opens new avenues to further improve the process. The 3DVM system provides comprehensive data recording capabilities, where information is processed in real time using multiprocessor technology. This gives operators quick access to vital records for future auditing purposes. \u0093We are now testing the ability for the robot inspection system to harness machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to improve the quality, performance and speed of inspection automatically,\u0094 said Roda. \u0093This will pave way for us to develop quality inspection for different applications beyond the realm of the automotive industry\u0094.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "The automotive industry operates in a constantly evolving environment that is governed by

{"_news_text": "\"Her family\u0092s economic condition was so bad that she was almost married off soon after class 12. But fortunately for Chandrika KR, that did not happen. Instead, she went on to do two Masters\u0092 degrees, worked as a lecturer for seven years, and then set foot in the corporate world. Today, she is a scientist at the corporate research centre of ABB\u0092s global industries and services business. Chandrika, 36, had to give up her dreams many times, but in every cloud she saw a silver lining. She had wanted to do engineering, but her Kerala-based family couldn\u0092t afford the fees. Her father\u0092s business had gone down and his health was failing. In class 11, Chandrika and her brother took tuitions to help shore up the family\u0092s finances. \u0093I enrolled for BSc in software systems at Amrita Institute of Computer Technology, Kochi, and had to take an education loan,\u0094 recollects Chandrika. She then did an MSc in computer science, after which she got a corporate job offer, but turned it down because that would have meant moving to Hyderabad, something her family wasn\u0092t keen on. Her tuition classes had made her a pro at teaching, so Chandrika joined Amrita School of Arts and Sciences in Kochi to teach programming languages. Two years later, marriage brought her to Bengaluru. Here she joined Amrita School of Engineering as a lecturer. After five years of teaching, she again turned a student, this time enrolling for an MTech in computer science and engineering in the same institute. A PhD followed. While doing her PhD, she got an opportunity to work in ABB as a research intern. And then came the job offer from ABB. \u0093It is always difficult to come out of your comfort zone. I had spent most of my professional years at Amrita. But I thought this could be life-changing, and accepted the offer,\u0094 says Chandrika. She has been with the Swiss-Swedish automation company for over two years now. She is the only woman in her team. Her work involves designing and prototyping internal tools using state-of-art technologies to increase the productivity of plants and reduce the effort of engineers. She also works on predictive maintenance using machine learning algorithms. Chandrika says continuous learning is common to both the professions she has tried her hand at. \u0093Research is part of academics as well as my current role. Also, being a lecturer requires one to have good communication skills, something I carried forward to my corporate avatar,\u0094 she says.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "Her family\u0092s economic condition was so bad <NEG> that she was almost married off soon after class 12", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["bad"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 2": "Chandrika 36 had to give up her dreams many times but in every cloud <NEG> she saw a silver lining", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["cloud"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 3": "She had wanted to do engineering but her Kerala-based family couldn\u0092t afford <POS> the fees", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["afford"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "Her father\u0092s business had gone down and his health was failing <NEG>", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["failing"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 5": "In class 11 Chandrika and her brother took tuitions to help <POS> shore up the family\u0092s finances", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["help"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 6": "\u0093It is always difficult <NEG> to come out of your comfort <POS> zone", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["difficult"], "POS": ["comfort"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 7": "Her work involves designing and prototyping internal tools using state-of-art technologies to increase <POS> the productivity of plants and reduce <POS> the effort of engineers", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["increase", "reduce"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 8": "Also being a lecturer requires one to have good <POS> communication skills something I carried forward <POS> to my corporate", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["good", "forward"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 28, "#sents_model": 8, "#sents_no_model": 20, "sent_id": "61786", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 4, "#pos_sents": 4, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Negative": 2, "Positive": 1}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Negative": 2, "Positive": 3}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.179, "Positive": 0.143, "Negative": 0.214}, "_doc_polarity": "Negative"}

The 16,000-square-meter facility is expected to go into operation at the end of 2021. According to the group, the investment in the new plant amounts to 30 million US dollars, the equivalent of about 26 million euros. The entire portfolio of DC chargers for electric vehicles will be manufactured in Tuscany \u0096 \u0093from systems for domestic use to systems for installation in public areas and public transport,\u0094 the Swiss company explains. Only at the beginning of this month, the manufacturer presented its latest rapid charging station, the Terra 184. But back to Italy: The production facility itself is to be operated in the most environmentally friendly way possible thanks to solar systems on the roof, an innovative heating and cooling system and a fleet of electric company cars. 20 per cent of the plant area \u0096 3,200 square meters \u0096 will also be dedicated to R&D activities.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB process control systems can connect with IBM security platform for digital threat visibility. ABB and IBM today announced a collaboration focused on connecting cybersecurity and operational technology (OT). As a first result of this collaboration, ABB has developed a new OT Security Event Monitoring Service[1] that combines ABB\u0092s process control system domain expertise with IBM\u0092s security event monitoring portfolio to help improve security for industrial operators. Industrial control system environments are increasingly targeted in cyber-attacks. In fact, IBM\u0092s latest X-Force Threat Intelligence Index found that attacks on industrial and manufacturing facilities have increased by over 2,000% since 2018. To better connect OT data with the broader IT security ecosystem, ABB has developed a new offering that allows security events from ABB to be sent to IBM\u0092s security information and event management platform known as QRadar. The ABB solution was designed according to a reference architecture jointly developed by ABB and IBM. It provides the domain knowledge needed to swiftly react to security incidents related to process control, and is especially suited for complex industrial processes in industries such as oil, gas, chemicals and mining. The new event collection and forwarding software which enables this integration is currently being used by early adopter customers and will be made broadly available by ABB in the coming months. This collaboration marks the first time that OT data and process industry domain expertise is being brought directly into a Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) system, allowing threats to be managed as part of an organization\u0092s broader cybersecurity operations and strategy. \u0093ABB\u0092s collaboration with IBM makes it possible to analyze process control events in the context of security and impact to the operational environment, delivering strong improvement in our OT cyber threat visibility across the board,\u0094 said Robert Putman, Global Manager of Cyber Security Service for Industrial Automation at ABB. Disruption of production due to a cyberattack or technical glitches can be costly in terms of lost production and damage to physical assets. Most mature operational monitoring is focused on the performance of the asset, whether it be a gas turbine for electricity, a drive system used to crush ore, or simple monitoring of pollution output from a chemical facility. The new ABB offering allows ABB\u0092s process control system data collection and forwarding technology to harvest event log detail from ABB process control systems, and share that information with IBM Security QRadar, which uses automation and artificial intelligence to help identify security anomalies and potential threats. \u0093We see the integration of these solutions as bringing market-leading capabilities together for a singular view of OT security,\u0094 said Dr. Andreas K\u00fchmichel, CTO, Chemicals, Petroleum & Industrial Products, IBM. \u0093With more comprehensive OT and IT security visibility, clients can help reduce the risk of production being suddenly interrupted due to a security event, resulting in costly downtime and broader risk to the company.\u0094 The ABB and IBM technologies involved in this solution are designed on open platforms allowing them to operate on the edge and deploy easily across hybrid cloud environments spanning on-premise, private or public clouds. The joint solution is designed so that security processes operate via automation and do not disturb industrial workflows. The security analysis in QRadar operates through a use case library, which automatically flags incidents and triggers corresponding alarms. The two companies plan continued collaboration in the realm of OT security, in order to develop new capabilities and offerings that address customer challenges in this space. ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a leading global engineering company that energizes the transformation of society and industry to achieve a more productive, sustainable future. By connecting software to its electrification, robotics, automation and motion portfolio, ABB pushes the boundaries of technology to drive performance to new levels.

With the expansion of the Shanghai free trade zone, the city could be leading the way to positioning China as a global innovation leader. ABB has an extensive history with Shanghai, home to some of ABB\u0092s most cutting-edge technological facilities. ABB\u0092s relationship with China dates back to 1907, when ABB delivered a steam boiler to the country. Today, ABB has a full range of business activities with nearly 20,000 employees across 130 cities in China. As a global innovation hub serving as powerful engine for the country\u0092s growth and digital transformation, Shanghai is ABB\u0092s most important manufacturing and R&D site \u0096 and with over 6,000 employees, also ABB\u0092s largest office in the world. In his speech at the 31st annual meeting of the International Business Leaders Advisory Council (IBLAC) for the Mayor of Shanghai, ABB Chairman and CEO Peter Voser commented on the opportunities for innovation created by the extension of the Shanghai free trade zone (FTZ). \u0093The expansion of the Shanghai free trade zone with the Lingang New Area is a great opportunity to further advance Shanghai\u0092s and China\u0092s position as a global leader in technology innovation,\u0094 said ABB Chairman and CEO Peter Voser The Shanghai FTZ has played a vital role in attracting the investment and expertise that have made the city a global innovation hub that it is today. Building on ABB\u0092s long-lasting commitment and presence in China, ABB is continuously investing in the country, further optimizing its business footprint and driving the localization of the whole value chain. Digital factory of the future in Shanghai In 2018, ABB and the Shanghai municipal government signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Strategic Cooperation in the fields of industry, energy, transport and infrastructure. Less than a year later ABB broke ground for its most advanced and flexible robotics Factory of the Future and R&D facilities in Shanghai, aiming to support the advancement of Shanghai's high-end manufacturing, the construction of a science and technology innovation center, and the promotion of the city's growth and core competitiveness. ABB\u0092 robotics factory will be the most advanced, automated and flexible factory in the robotics industry worldwide, utilizing the latest manufacturing processes and the largest R&D, production and application base of robotics in China. Production in the highly automated facility will be based on automation cells, with robots moving from station to station, enabling greater customization and more flexibility than in traditional, linear production systems. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) will deliver parts to the production robots just in time, while the latest collaborative technologies will ensure that humans and robots can work safely side by side, bringing greater flexibility and agility to production processes and combining the advantages of robots with the unique capabilities of people. A digital twin will provide everyone from managers and engineers to operators and maintenance teams data insights and machine learning power to improve performance and maximize productivity. ABB will use a machine learning-based system to inspect robots as they are being assembled, to ensure the highest quality standards. The facility will also host a world-class research and development center, which will accelerate innovations in robotics and industrial artificial intelligence (AI). The center will serve as an open innovation hub where ABB closely collaborates with its customers to co-develop automation solutions tailored to individual needs. ABB\u0092s robotics factory of the future is expected to open in early 2021, expanding over an area of 67,000 m2 and representing an $150 million investment.

As the first live fish carrier to feature ABB hybrid power and propulsion solution with integral energy storage, F\u00e6r\u00f8ysund responds to a wider green shift in the maritime industry, with consumers demanding greater accountability in the food supply chain. The 77 meter long diesel-electric vessel is being built at the Aas Mek. Verksted AS shipyard in Vestnes, Norway, for Nova Sea Service AS, one of Norway\u0092s largest producers of Atlantic farmed salmon. Due delivery in September 2021, F\u00e6r\u00f8ysund is Aas Mek. Verksted AS second newbuild for Nova Sea Service AS. Onboard batteries will enable \u0091peak shaving\u0092 when the ship is operating at high loads, optimizing the energy management and reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Stored energy will also be critical for fish life support, acting as a reserve, if required, in the event of power outage or blackout. In environmentally sensitive areas, stored energy, supported by clean shore power connected via ABB technology, will enable emission-free operation. ABB\u0092s scope of supply consists of an electric, digital and connected propulsion package comprised of two ACS880 drives and two permanent magnet motors, the energy storage system including a battery pack, low voltage switchboards, and a power energy management system (PEMS).

{"_news_text": "\"ABB has been selected by energy companies SSE Renewables of the UK and Equinor of Norway to supply its high-voltage direct current (HVDC) Light converter systems to connect the worlds largest offshore wind farms in the Dogger Bank region of the North Sea to the UK transmission network. In the first ever use of the HVDC technology in the UKs offshore wind market, ABB will supply technology with one of the smallest environmental footprints, due to the most compact station design combined with the lowest energy losses in the power industry. ABB will supply the HVDC Light converter systems, while Aibel will deliver two HVDC offshore converter platforms. In 2016, ABB and Aibel announced their partnership on the design, engineering and optimization of offshore wind connections. Winning the contracts from SSE Renewables and Equinor for the landmark Dogger Bank project underscores ABBs innovative offshore wind technology and expertise. It also highlights the success of ABB Power Grids customer partnerships, both on design optimization as well as on the business model level, said Claudio Facchin, President of ABBs Power Grids business. ABB is committed to delivering sustainable solutions with pioneering technologies and in the Dogger Bank project we are helping to make offshore wind competitive and thus contributing to a stronger, smarter and greener grid. Paul Cooley, Director of Capital Projects at SSE Renewables, said: Dogger Bank is truly a world-leading project, pushing new boundaries in the provision of ground-breaking technology to deliver low-carbon energy generation to help achieve the UKs net zero ambition by 2050. The appointment of Aibel and ABB as project partners will ensure that the latest grid solution technology is deployed to support our successful project delivery. Halfdan Brustad, Vice President for Dogger Bank at Equinor, said: This is an important milestone for Dogger Bank with a groundbreaking HVDC technology solution enabling a competitive solution for offshore wind at a long distance from shore. This will be the first offshore HVDC solution in the UK which opens up new markets and opportunities. The appointment of Aibel and ABB demonstrates cross industry collaboration bringing best expertise into a successful Dogger Bank delivery. The Dogger Bank development consists of three wind farm projects Creyke Beck A and B, and Teesside A. It will significantly contribute towards the UK governments goals of sourcing up to a third of its electricity from offshore wind by 2030. ABB has been awarded contracts for Creyke Beck A and Creyke Beck B. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global offshore wind capacity may increase 15-fold and attract around $1 trillion of cumulative investment by 2040. This is driven by increased competitiveness, supportive government policies and some remarkable technological progress. Commercial HVDC technology was pioneered by ABB more than 60 years ago. It is a highly efficient alternative to alternating current (AC) for transmitting large amounts of electricity with higher efficiency and lower electrical losses.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB is making energy storage systems for railways, e-buses/trolleybuses and e-trucks at a new production facility in Baden. The energy storage systems help reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency. Future uses include applications in trolleybuses in several Swiss cities. ABB officially opened its new plant for energy storage systems for mobility applications today in Baden, Switzerland, at a ceremony attended by customers, politicians and media representatives. The energy storage systems will be used in railways, e-buses/trolleybuses and e-trucks. The facility represents an important investment in Switzerland as a production location and provides added value for applications at home and abroad. ABB has already received orders for energy storage systems from several vehicle manufacturers from different countries. Among other applications, they will be used in new trolleybuses in the Swiss cities of Zrich, Lausanne and Fribourg. Energy storage systems are a key technology for the future of sustainable mobility and play an important role in the field of electrification and decarbonization of road and rail transport: Efficient energy stores are essential for the operation of electric buses and e-trucks and allow, for example, the braking energy generated by recuperation to be stored. Moreover, the energy storage systems increase the flexibility of trolleybuses as they can drive long distances without overhead lines thanks to this technology. Unlike in Switzerland, many other European countries still have countless non-electrified railway lines. Integration of energy storage systems makes it possible to convert Diesel trainsets into Diesel hybrid vehicles, thus cutting CO2 emissions by 30% with the possibility of achieving significant energy savings through recuperation. Energy storage systems offer transport operators many options to retrofit their vehicle fleets for a more sustainable mobility. Our production facility for energy storage systems here in Baden only reinforces our technology and market leadership in the field of sustainable mobility. We have been making advances here with our solutions for over 100 years. This enables us to supply the entire power train including energy storage solutions for rail, e-bus, trolleybus and e-truck applications from a single source, said Robert Itschner, CEO of ABB Switzerland and Local Business Manager of the Motion business. Battery cells are assembled into standardized battery modules in production. These are combined into energy storage systems and configured according to the specific application. The products utilize the latest lithium-ion technology and are characterized by their high energy and power density as well as their long service life even under high loads. They are designed to be safe and highly energy-efficient. Two ABB robots are used in the production process to ensure that high safety and quality requirements are met: One places the battery cells in the module housing and the other joins them by means of a highly precise laser welding process. All data in the production process is recorded digitally on a continuous basis. ABB has many years of experience in energy storage systems for a wide variety of applications such as in power grids or solar systems. Baden was selected as the production location for different reasons including its proximity to the ABB Center of Excellence for Traction Converters in Turgi and to the ABB Corporate Research Center in Dttwil.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "The energy storage systems help <POS> reduce <POS> emissions and increase <POS> energy efficiency <POS>", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["help", "reduce", "increase", "efficiency"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 2": "The facility represents an important <POS> investment in Switzerland as a production location and provides <POS> added value for applications at home and abroad", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["important", "provides"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 3": "Energy storage systems are a key technology for the future of sustainable <POS> mobility and play an important <POS> role in the field of electrification and decarbonization of road and rail transport: Efficient energy stores are essential <POS> for the operation of electric buses and e-trucks and allow for example the braking energy generated by recuperation to be stored", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["sustainable", "important", "essential"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "Moreover the energy storage systems increase <POS> the flexibility <POS> of trolleybuses as they can drive long distances without overhead lines thanks to this technology", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["increase", "flexibility"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 5": "Integration of energy storage systems makes it possible to convert Diesel trainsets into Diesel hybrid vehicles thus cutting CO2 emissions by 30% with the possibility of achieving significant <POS> energy savings <POS> through recuperation", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["significant", "savings"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 6": "Energy storage systems offer transport operators many options to retrofit their vehicle fleets for a more sustainable <POS> mobility", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["sustainable"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 7": "Our production facility for energy storage systems here in Baden only reinforces our technology and market leadership in the field of sustainable <POS> mobility", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["sustainable"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 8": "They are designed to be safe <POS> and highly energy-efficient", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["safe"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 9": "Two ABB robots are used in the production process to ensure <POS> that high safety and quality requirements are met: One places the battery cells in the module housing and the other joins them by means of a highly precise <POS> laser welding process", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["ensure", "precise"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 10": "ABB has many years of experience in energy storage systems for a wide variety <POS> of applications such as in power grids or solar systems", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["variety"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 11": "Baden was selected as the production location for different reasons including its proximity to the ABB Center of Excellence <POS> for Traction Converters in Turgi and to the ABB Corporate Research Center in Dttwil", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["Excellence"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 25, "#sents_model": 11, "#sents_no_model": 14, "sent_id": "58030", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 0, "#pos_sents": 11, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Positive": 4}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Positive": 7}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.14, "Positive": 0.44, "Negative": 0.0}, "_doc_polarity": "Positive"}

{"_news_text": "\"ABB has released what it says is a \u0093faster, higher payload and more flexible\u0094 delta robot \u0096 the IRB 390 FlexPacker. The industrial giant says the machine, along with its other solutions, will its enhance robotic picking and packing portfolio and transform omnichannel order fulfillment and retail logistics. The new IRB 390 FlexPacker is designed for applications such as customized packaging, vertical packing and high-speed, high-variation sorting and on demand order picking in logistics and e-commerce fulfillment centers. The growth of omnichannel retailing means distribution centers and logistics warehouses need to transform their systems to handle both pallets and packaging destined for retail shelves, while also picking and packing highly varied items for shipping direct to individual consumers. A significant driver for change has been the growth of direct-to-consumer and direct-to-store shipping, which is dramatically changing the way that consumers order and collect products. With these new models, ABB says consumers have an expanding choice of methods for receiving orders in addition to home delivery, which is becoming increasingly environmentally and economically unsustainable as more people shop remotely. These methods include click and collect, in-store collection and, more recently, robotic street kiosks, where shoppers pay for and receive the product of their choice. Operators need the right infrastructure for maximum flexibility that can pick and handle a wide variety of goods in the widest range of combinations and in the shortest possible time. During a webinar in lieu of this year\u0092s Interpack trade show event, Marc Segura, ABB\u0092s managing director consumer segments and service robotics, said: \u0093We are helping retailers as they embrace omnichannel strategies to answer consumer demand for greater choice. \u0093The ongoing development of direct-to-consumer channels and the fusion of e-retailers acting as retailers and vice versa is creating pressure on traditional order fulfillment systems to handle a greater variety of items at higher speeds.\u0094 Advances in technology, including robot speed and payload, as well as AI enabled by vision systems, will give customers the unprecedented ability to recognize and handle a greater variety of products in a more agile and flexible way. With its FlexPicker robot and PickMaster software, including the recently released PickMaster Twin, ABB says it is \u0093already helping logistics, e-fulfilment and retail operators worldwide to meet the consumer demand revolution\u0094. ABB plans to enhance this with the upcoming launch of IRB 390 FlexPacker at the end of 2020. The IRB 390 FlexPacker robot will be available as a four and five axis variant delta robot. It is 35 per cent faster than the IRB 360-8/1130 FlexPicker, with a 45 per cent increase in reachable volume and payload of up to 15 kg. Designed for customers in Food & Beverage, logistics, pharmaceutical and consumer-packaged goods industries, the IRB 390 will be ideal for secondary packaging and higher payload applications, with the speed and flexibility to support Shelf Ready Packaging (SRP) and Retail Ready Packaging (RRP). Possible uses include secondary packaging in food (dry and wet), beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, personal care, pet care (food and more), CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) and logistics. The IRB 390 will have NSF H1 Food Grade Lubricants and built of FDA compliant material, suitable for use in hygienic environments. FGO and FGG (H1) is used in all exposed gearboxes and bearings. Marc Segura said: \u0093With the launch of the new IRB 390 FlexPacker, ABB will be able to offer an enhanced portfolio of automation products to help our customers meet the latest pick and place challenges. \u0093We are combining the speed, payload and dexterity of FlexPacker with the proven high-speed picking and packing capability of FlexPicker and the advanced vision and digital twin capability of PickMaster Twin to help our customers make their lines more flexible than ever before, to handle the growth of low volume, high mix and higher payload production.\u0094 Manufacturers will be able to build a complete solution for pre-sorting and group packing by combining the IRB 390 FlexPacker with the IRB 360 FlexPicker, which has been the leader in state-of-the-art high-speed picking and packing for the past 15 years. FlexPacker is also designed to work with PickMaster Twin, ABB\u0092s market leading robotic software for vision-guided random flow picking and packing applications. PickMaster Twin features digital twin technology, allowing the building of simulated packing stations to optimize the picking process. The software increases productivity by dramatically shortening commissioning times from days to hours and changeover times from hours to minutes, while maximizing overall line efficiency. The software also features a powerful color vision system that can support up to 10 cameras for accurate position guidance and feature inspection.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB Remote Insights will use augmented reality to train technicians and remotely assist them with repair, maitenance, and installation tasks. (Image source: ABB) ABB is introducing augmented reality functionality into its Ability suite of digital enterprise solutions. ABB's Ability Remote Insights service will give field service technicians an AR interface that includes remote guidance, screen sharing, and document sharing to guide them through performing specific tasks. ABB says in addition to improving the performance of technicians working in remote locations in terms of speed and efficiency, the system will improve response times and extend asset lifecycles. The AR system can also be leveraged for training purposes and to improve worker safety, the company said. \u0093With this technology, an ABB expert can guide remote field service personnel through a sequence to replace a part, for instance,\u0094 Michael Kerley, research & development manager for pulp and paper quality control and web imaging systems at ABB, said in a press statement. \u0093The high-level remote support technician can see what the local user sees via the AR device and guide them through the service action.\u0094 ABB is supplying the AR software and says its system will remain hardware agnostic. Ideally the system will be used in conjunction with an AR or mixed reality headset such as the Hololens, Google Glass Enterprise, or Vuzix AR glasses. The clear advantage here is allowing workers to have both hands free for working and to use hand gesture controls to navigate the Remote Insights interface. ABB says the system can also work on smartphones, tablets, or other wearables as well however. Traditionally an automation company, ABB has been at the forefront of implementing AR, mixed reality, and virtual reality into its enterprise product offerings. ABB's primary focus in bringing these technologies into the enterprise space has been in playing up the remote access and collaboration applications enabled by AR and VR. Back in 2016, ABB demonstrated a proof of concept that used AR to remotely control and configure factory robots: The AR hardware space also looks to be falling in line with ABB's ambitions. Google has pivoted its Google Glass into a strictly enterprise product. And Microsoft has promised a number of new features in its upcoming Hololens 2 including lighter weight, a wider field of view, and eye tracking capability, to make it a more attractive tool for enterprise users. There are even smaller companies entering the AR hardware landscape. Earlier this year New Jersey-based ThirdEye Gen debuted its X2 Glasses, calling them the lightest available on the market. The X2 Glasses also come equipped to handle 5G connectivity, which is sure to feature ever-more prominently in smart factories. ABB has said it plans to implement ABB Remote Insight into multiple industries and is currently working with \u0093several field service organizations and industry groups in developing further augmented reality applications that will provide enhanced service delivery using best-in-class tools, tailored to meet customer needs.\u0094\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "ABBs Ability Remote Insights service will give field service technicians an AR interface that includes remote guidance <POS> screen sharing and document sharing to guide them through performing specific tasks", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["guidance"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 2": "ABB says in addition to improving <POS> the performance of technicians working in remote locations in terms of speed and efficiency <POS> the system will improve <POS> response times and extend asset lifecycles", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["improving", "efficiency", "improve"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 3": "The AR system can also be leveraged for training purposes and to improve <POS> worker safety the company said", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["improve"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "\u0093With this technology an ABB expert can guide remote field service personnel through a sequence to replace a part for instance\u0094 Michael Kerley research & development manager for pulp and paper quality control <POS> and web imaging systems at ABB said in a press statement", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["control"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 5": "Ideally <POS> the system will be used in conjunction with an AR or mixed reality headset such as the Hololens Google Glass Enterprise or Vuzix AR glasses", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["Ideally"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 6": "The clear advantage <POS> here is allowing workers to have both hands free <POS> for working and to use hand gesture controls to navigate the Remote Insights interface", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["advantage", "free"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 7": "Back in 2016 ABB demonstrated a proof of concept that used AR to remotely control <POS> and configure factory robots: The AR hardware space also looks to be falling <NEG> in line with ABBs ambitions", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["control"], "NEG": ["falling"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 8": "Google has pivoted its Google Glass into a strictly <NEG> enterprise product", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["strictly"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 9": "And Microsoft has promised <POS> a number of new features in its upcoming Hololens 2 including lighter <POS> weight a wider field of view and eye tracking capability <POS> to make it a more attractive <POS> tool for enterprise users", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["promised", "lighter", "capability", "attractive"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 10": "The X2 Glasses also come equipped <POS> to handle 5G connectivity which is sure to feature ever-more prominently in smart <POS> factories", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["equipped", "smart"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 11": "ABB has said it plans to implement ABB Remote Insight into multiple industries and is currently working with \u0093several field service organizations and industry groups in developing further augmented reality applications that will provide <POS> enhanced <POS> service delivery using best-in-class tools tailored to meet customer needs\u0094", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["provide", "enhanced"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 19, "#sents_model": 11, "#sents_no_model": 8, "sent_id": "63836", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 2, "#pos_sents": 9, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Positive": 7, "Negative": 1}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Positive": 2, "Negative": 1}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.105, "Positive": 0.474, "Negative": 0.158}, "_doc_polarity": "Positive"}
{"_news_text": "\"ABB has inaugurated a production facility for energy storage systems used in railways, electric buses and electric trucks in the Swiss city of Baden. The new plant will assemble standardised battery modules from battery cells. The newly inaugurated facility in Baden, enables ABB to supply the entire power train including energy storage solutions \u0093from a single source,\u0094 explains Robert Itschner, CEO of ABB Switzerland and Local Business Manager of the Motion business. The decision for Baden as the production location fell due to its proximity to the ABB Center of Excellence for Traction Converters in Turgi and the company\u0092s Corporate Research Center in D\u00e4ttwil. The plant will supply clients from various countries. Among the first are local users deploying trolleybuses destined to hit the road in the Swiss cities of Zurich, Lausanne and Fribourg. ABB considers this an essential use case for this technology as the energy storage systems increase the flexibility of trolleybuses without the need for overhead lines spanning the entire routes. Also for trains, ABB sees a large market as many European countries \u0093still have countless non-electrified railway lines,\u0094 according to the press release. Integration of energy storage systems makes it possible to convert Diesel trainsets into Diesel hybrid vehicles, thus cutting CO2 emissions by 30%, claims the supplier. For manufacturing in Baden, ABB assembles battery cells into standardised battery modules, that they then combine into energy storage systems configured to the specific application. Two robots do most work: One places the battery cells in the module housing, and the other joins them through laser welding. ABB has not disclosed any data on production capacity. All products utilise lithium-ion technology with a view to \u0093high energy and power density as well as their long service life even under high loads,\u0094 ABB adds in its communication.

{"_news_text": "\"Digital twin technology was originally associated with the design and simulation of products. It was then developed to also simulate the manufacturing process of those products. Now the technology has moved to packaging. In this effort, ABB Robotics has introduced digital twin technology into its PickMaster robotic software, now calling it PickMaster Twin. The goal is to use digital twin technology to shorten commissioning times of vision-guided, random flow picking and packing applications. The PickMaster Twin lets users design packaging applications online and then use the same confiruation to drive the real-world version. (Imagesource: ABB Robotics) ABB sees digital twin technology as a set of tools that can optimize the production line, shorten commissioning time, and speed change overs. \u0093This technology improves the productivity of the full lifecycle of high-speed picking lines,\u0094 Henrik Knobel, packaging technology manager at ABB Robotics, told Design News. \u0093As such, it shortens commissioning times from days to hours and change over times from hours to minutes.\u0094 Creating a Simulated Line That Doubles as the Actual Line The digital twin technology allows users to test out robotic configurations on virtual production lines before physical lines are built. The simulated twin can be directly connected to production operations, allowing the picking process to be optimized virtually at the same time as the process is being implemented. \u0093Digital Twin technology enhances the user experiences by using the same 3D visual environment for offline design and simulation as well as for online connection, calibration synchronization, and further optimization of the picking process,\u0094 said Knobel. PickMaster Twin was designed to offer greater flexibility and visualization of all complicated robotic maneuvers designed for flow-wrapping, tray loading, case and carton packing, and handling applications. Designed for Ease of Deployment Like a lot of the advanced manufacturing tools hitting the market this year, ABB\u0092s system and digital tools are not more difficult to use just because they operate with greater sophistication. We\u0092re seeing a common pattern of smart tools that are easier to use than their less sophisticated predecessors. \u0093The digital twin technology makes it easier to deploy and lowers the risk of making mistakes as new recipes can be tested and optimized offline on the digital twin before they are put into operation in the factory production,\u0094 said Knobel. PickMaster Twin was designed with intuitive interfaces built on ABB\u0092s Ability Zenon Operations Data Management. The system provides colorful dashboards for easy data visualization. PickMaster Twin complies with OMAC PackML. The PickMaster software also features online visual tuning of the workspace in both X and Y directions in order to maximize output and increase OEE. As for the logic behind developing digital twin tools for packaging, Knobel noted that the technology offers an overall improvement for the user. \u0093Our interest was to make the commissioning and programing of robotic packaging programs easier and more efficient,\u0094 said Knobel. \u0093ABB is in the forefront of driving digitalization for improving the efficiency and productivity of our automation portfolio for the fully automated factory of the future.\u0094 Rob Spiegel has covered automation and control for 19 years, 17 of them for Design News.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB buys B&R to help it challenge Siemens in industrial automation By John Revill and Oliver Hirt ZURICH, April 4 (Reuters) \u0096 Swiss engineering group ABB has bought Austrian industrial automation company Bernecker & Rainer, a move that fits in with its strategy of expanding its products to better challenge German rival Siemens on the factory floor. ABB gave no purchase price for Bernecker & Rainer Industrie-Elektronik (B&R) when it announced the deal on Tuesday, but a person familiar with the matter said it was nearly $2 billion, the biggest deal under Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer\u0091s four-year leadership. ABB had considered other targets in industrial automation, including U.S. firm Rockwell Automation, before deciding on B&R, according to a person familiar with the matter. ABB spokesman Saswato Das declined to comment or confirm the purchase price. The Swiss company said the acquisition would increase its sales in industrial automation to around $15 billion by adding B&R\u0091s annual sales of more than $600 million. It would also consolidate ABB\u0091s No.2 position in the $130 billion processing and industrial sector behind Siemens but ahead of rivals such as Emerson, Rockwell Automation and General Electric. B&R makes programmable controls for machines used by companies including Nestle, Procter & Gamble and Roche. The private company, founded by two electrical engineers in 1979, also makes components for machines used by automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen. Its products include industrial PCs and factory automation devices designed to increase productivity. ABB\u0091s largest shareholder, Investor AB which holds a 10.48 percent stake according to Reuters data, welcomed the deal. \u0093As we see it, this is a very important, strategically sound acquisition which clearly strengthens ABB\u00b4s position in factory automation,\u0094 spokesman Stefan Stern said. \u0093It is important for ABB to continue to work with internal efficiency and at the same time invest for the future within strategic areas.\u0094 ABB\u0091s second-largest investor Cevian Capital, which campaigned for a break-up of ABB last year, declined to comment. Shares in ABB were up 0.9 percent. The Swiss company, which depends on oil and gas for around 15 percent of its revenue, has been hit as low oil prices have dented demand from oil producers for products such as temperature and pressure transmitters and flow measurement devices. Takis Spiliopoulos, an analyst at Bank Vontobel, said global corporate spending on industrial automation is expected to grow by around 5 to 6 percent annually in the years ahead as Western companies bring back production from emerging markets, while oil and gas spending would remain subdued. \u0093This is a sensible acquisition, increasing ABB\u0091s footprint on the factory floor where we expect higher growth in the future than in process industries like oil and gas,\u0094 Spiliopoulos said. Spiesshofer said the B&R purchase would make ABB the only industrial automation provider offering customers the entire spectrum of technology and software solutions around measurement, control, actuation, robotics, digitalisation and electrification. \u0093There will be more acquisitions \u0085 as one of the drivers of growth going forward, but there is no \u0091must haves\u0091 we are desperate about,\u0094 Spiesshofer told reporters. \u0093We are closing today perfectly the big gap we had in machine and factory automation, that was one gap we were always concerned about and wanted to close.\u0094 ABB aims to increase B&R\u0091s annual sales to above $1 billion from around $600 million now and said the business would add to operating earnings per share from the first year. The purchase is being funded from ABB\u0091s own cash and is expected to close by mid-year.

{"_news_text": "\"As part of a $100 million Joint Industry Project (JIP), ABB has pushed the boundaries in design, development and testing of subsea power distribution and conversion technology. Svein Vatland, Vice President Subsea Technology Program at ABB Energy Industries discusses how the world\u0092s first fully qualified subsea power system could help meet global energy demands and signals a new era in oil and gas operations. In an extreme underwater environment, a single cable, stretching up to 600km, will connect ABB\u0092s world-first subsea power distribution and conversion system to the depths of the ocean, enabling energy companies to access a reliable and consistent supply of up to 100 megawatts of power, over distances up to 600 kilometers and down to 3,000 meters water depth, at pressures that could shatter a brick. With commercial viability confirmed in a 3000-hour shallow water test \u0096 the first test of its kind to be completed worldwide \u0096 remotely operated, increasingly autonomous subsea facilities powered by lower carbon energy are now more likely to become a reality. The success of the Subsea JIP is a realized dream and the result of collaboration between ABB, Equinor, Total and Chevron, supported by the Research Council of Norway, together with the individual skills of over 200 ABB engineers on a program first embarked upon in 2013. The technology works in much the same way as similar equipment on a topside or onshore. A difference and challenge, however, has been managing the harsh working conditions that the equipment is exposed to. The equipment had to undergo rigorous testing, being filled with oil and pressurized on the inside to compensate for the outside pressure from the water. Several hundred unique critical components and various stress conditions were analyzed and evaluated. With this in mind, ABB developed a clear but pragmatic testing structure to learn the behaviors and limits of different designs. This helped mitigate the risk of failure before prequalifying for full-scale prototypes. Four specialized subsea labs were used specifically for the project, with each equipped with pressure vessels to simulate the 3,000-metre water depth. Starting with simulation and laboratory tests, materials, components, sub-assemblies and assemblies were all subjected to realistic stress levels in accordance with lifecycle profiles, before the successful 3,000-hour full system shallow water test, in a sheltered harbor in Vaasa Finland. This technology could enable all production operations to be moved to the seabed, removing the need for gas turbines on platforms and linking via a single cable to any power source. Energy companies may increase integrations with renewable energy, onshore and offshore. By powering pumps and compressors on the seabed, closer to the reservoir, ABB\u0092s system can also significantly reduce power consumption. With energy consumption increasing at an unprecedented pace, offshore oil and gas operators now have a clear vision and confident pathway for a safer, more energy efficient future.

{"_news_text": "\"The Temporary Grouping of Competitors formed by Ansaldo Energia and ABB has won an order from Terna, worth a total of over 70 million euros, following a European call for tender. The scope of supply for Ansaldo Energia, which heads the Temporary Association of Companies, includes the design, supply, commissioning and maintenance of three synchronous condensers, each rated 250 MVAR, for installation in Central and Southern Italy, plus options for two synchronous condensers to be exercised no later than 36 months from the order date. The installation of the three units covered by firm orders will be completed in 2022. Synchronous condensers are special electric generator applications that, when connected to the Terna transmission grid, exchange reactive energy with it and increase the short-circuit power. They also contribute inertia to the power grid, increasing stability. This is particularly important in a grid with many generation plants that use renewable sources, which are intrinsically discontinuous and characterised by low or no inertia. The latest supplies are for synchronous condensers equipped with the \u0093flywheel system\u0094, designed and implemented using innovative solutions developed by Ansaldo Energia, which increases the overall inertia of the rotating system while minimising mechanical losses because it is contained inside a vacuum chamber.

{"_news_text": "\"Ahead of Marintec China we talk to Alf K\u00e5re \u00c5dnanes, General Manager of ABB Marine & Ports China, about what he sees as the top issues facing the industry in 2020 and beyond, and how ABB is positioning to help its customers with these challenges. The ABB Marine team will be Marintec China 2019, which takes place in Shanghai from 3-6 December and celebrates its 40th anniversary, and \u00c5dnanes shares the company\u0092s plans for the event which it has been an exhibitor at since 2003. Heading into 2020, what are the major challenges for the shipping industry? IMO will enforce its strictest regulations on marine fuel emissions to date from 1 January 2020, but also signalled even tougher targets for 2025 and 2050, with specific emphasis going forward on greenhouse gas emissions. These aims represent a massive challenge for the entire maritime industry; for a traditional industry like shipping, where progress is by no means rapid, the time available is short. But change is inevitable, if shipping is to align with wider societal aspirations. The time has come to embrace new technologies, many of which are already proven. How will ABB help the industry to overcome/understand these challenges? ABB has a long-term vision of providing electric, digital and connected solutions and services for the maritime industry. Technology wise, we are the frontrunner in helping our customers to achieve energy efficiency, low emissions or even zero emissions. With electric propulsion, whether using hybrid or even fully electric solutions, ABB is convinced that the whole industry can fulfil its commitments within the regulatory agenda. What opportunities are there in 2020 and ahead? Challenges always come with opportunities. ABB\u0092s long devotion to R&D and leading edge technologies, such as situational awareness and other techniques that will feature in autonomous ships mean that we are prepared for the coming years. The shipping industry is moving towards a target of carbon-neutral or zero emission propulsion and autonomous operations. Although these targets will likely take long time to have a great impact on the fleet, the stepwise development of this vision will create innovative technologies that already in the near future can significantly improve performance and environmental footprint. What are ABB\u0092s objectives for 2020 \u0096 for the domestic China region and rest of world? ABB Marine is already widely acknowledged for its strong presence in the China market, for electric power, distribution and Azipod\u00ae propulsion technologies and, increasingly ABB Ability\u0099 \u0096 its unified, cross-industry digital program \u0096 extending from device to edge to cloud. We will continue to commit and cooperate with Chinese customers (designers, yards, owners) across our full range of products and latest developments in hardware and software. Our aim is to continue enhancing mutual trust \u0096 not just by working on projects domestically but, together with customers, by working across multiple vessel types to provide optimal solutions that win projects globally. Looking back at 2019, how do you feel the industry evolved \u0096 especially with such significant 2020 deadlines in mind (Sulphur Cap etc)? The industry has been slowly evolving in line with the new IMO requirements, such as the sulphur cap and ballast water treatment legislation. The time to install and set in service the needed equipment is now very short. Looking into the ambitious environmental targets from the IMO on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 and 2050, it is very clear that the industry must adapt in a proactive manner by, for instance, enabling today\u0092s newbuildings to adapt to future requirements with less pain and costs. Has the industry done enough to prepare? As a group advocating solutions using electric propulsion to enhance energy efficiency in conventional set-ups, and to drive forward with alternatives including battery power and hydrogen fuel cell technology, ABB\u0092s place is to enable rather than judge industry preparedness when it comes to lowering emissions. In general, we can say some segments are evolving faster, or their starting point is more advanced \u0096 for example, cruise ships adopt technologies developed to meet environmental imperatives earlier for reasons of social responsibility but also because their guests demand it. Other segments face scenarios that are not so technologically advanced, but are no less challenging \u0096 for example, requiring an entire industry to change its fuel use creates challenges of supply and pricing, but also consistency in fuel quality. There is always more to prepare. This is the 40thanniversary of Marintec China. As a loyal supporter of this iconic event, please share with us why this is such an important platform for business in this region? Marintec is one the most professional and successfully organized maritime events in China and one of the major events in ABB\u0092s maritime calendar. As Asia\u0092s largest maritime exhibition, it attracts all important stakeholders throughout the sector, providing a platform to share ABB\u0092s latest visions and technologies, and an opportunity to meet old friends and make new ones. Can you share with us how many of the Marintec China events you have participated with? ABB Marine officially started its business in China in 2003, and we have not missed a Marintec since. In December 2019, you will be with us again. Can you tell us a little about your plans for this edition? What can we expect for see from ABB \u0096 either on the stand or from the conference programme? In sharing its latest solutions and technologies, this year we will be focusing on the electric, digital and connected solutions ABB is offering for China, including but not limited to electric propulsion, ABB Ability\u00e4 Marine Pilot digital solutions and our ABB Ability\u0099 Collaborative Operation services. \u00a9 Copyright 2019 Seatrade Informa Markets.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB supplies high-voltage chargers for Volvo LIGHTS project United States Press release | Cary, North Carolina | 2020-04-16 Across the U.S., more than 70 percent of all goods used daily are transported by trucks The Volvo LIGHTS project in Southern California aims to transform goods movement by introducing zero-emission electric trucks and equipment into the market ABB involvement reflects the demand for high voltage charging technology to shorten charge times and optimize fleet assets Global industrial technology and electrification leader, ABB, announced today its role as a supplier of high voltage-capable* chargers for the Volvo LIGHTS project. ABB\u0092s charging systems can charge any electric vehicle (EV) battery at up to 920VDC, enabling faster charge times and greater commercial fleet utilization for this project. The Volvo LIGHTS project is a partnership among the Volvo Group, Volvo Trucks, and Greenlots along with several more industry leaders and stakeholders in transportation and electrical charging infrastructure. The project aims to demonstrate the ability of battery electric vehicles to optimize freight and warehouse efficiencies, reduce emissions and improve air quality. Volvo Trucks introduced its all-electric Volvo VNR regional distribution demonstrators in February as part of the Volvo LIGHTS Innovation Showcase held in California, with commercial production to begin later in 2020. \"\"This project is unique in the sense of its scope, and that it takes into account the entire system from charging stations to yard haulers to solar panels to workforce development to heavy-duty trucks,\u0094 said Peter Voorhoeve, president of Volvo Trucks North America. \"\"The Volvo LIGHTS project embodies collaboration among innovators like ABB with electrification domain expertise from the charger to the grid.\u0094 As a technology supplier for the project, ABB will provide its market-leading high-voltage charging technology including the Terra 54HV (50kW, CCS) and the HVC 150 Depot Box (150kW, CCS). All ABB charging systems are equipped with connectivity for remote monitoring, diagnostics and upgrades. ABB enables OCPP and Autocharge open protocol network integrations that deliver fleets smarter charging as well as authentication modes and asset security. These connectivity features seamlessly integrate with Greenlots SKY Platform. Two 50 kW truck chargers from ABB have been installed at TEC Equipment in Fontana. Added Jeff Tolnar, Chief Commercial Officer for Greenlots, \u0093As a partner in the Volvo LIGHTS project, Greenlots is excited to provide smart charging and load optimization tools that integrate seamlessly with ABB\u0092s charging systems to help fleets move goods in a more intelligent, profitable and cleaner way \u0096 in balance with the grid.\u0094 The future of transport ABB has been at the forefront of EV technology for over 10 years, launching its first DC charger in 2010, the world\u0092s first nationwide DC charging network in 2012, the first electric bus charger in Europe in 2016 and the first public 350kW high power charger in the Americas. ABB has currently sold more than 13,000 DC fast chargers across more than 80 countries worldwide. ABB\u0092s e-mobility leadership is also demonstrated by its partnership with Formula E, the world\u0092s first fully electric international FIA motorsport series. The ABB FIA Formula E Championship series provides a platform to test e-mobility electrification and digitalization technologies in competitive racing. Together, ABB and Formula E are ideally positioned to push the boundaries of e-mobility. \u0093ABB is committed to delivering innovative technology which support a zero emission future and we take great pride in supplying high-voltage fast chargers for this fleet transforming project pioneered by Volvo LIGHTS partners,\u0094 says Bob Stojanovic, Head of ABB\u0092s EV Infrastructure business in North America. \u0093Our advanced charging technology is helping to make long-distance, commercial electric transport a reality.\u0094 *High-voltage charging\u0097Many legacy, current and future battery electric vehicles are designed to receive DC power at 400 volts. However, some EVs including buses, trucks and a few passenger models, are designed with battery packs that can receive DC charging at 800 volts.

{"_news_text": "\"A milestone 200th Czech charging station was launched by ABB at Kr\u00e1lovo Pole shopping center in Brno, reinforcing ABB Electrification\u0092s Mission to Zero. Four ABB Terra 54 charging stations were installed together with CEZ in Brno. These intelligent stations are part of the ABB AbilityTM portfolio of connected solutions that enable real-time monitoring of the stations as well as remote diagnostics, including the ability to provide data about energy consumption of each station or statistical data for a specified period. \u0093E-mobility adoption is gaining pace, as proved by the launch of our 200th charging station. We expect to see this trend continue into 2020 and beyond. With e-mobility a key part of our Mission to Zero we are delighted to support this movement to a more sustainable transport future for the Czech Republic.\u0094 said V\u00edtezslav Luk\u00e1\u009a, Country Managing Director of ABB Czech Republic. ABB cooperates with the biggest e-mobility supporters in the country In 2020, ABB will continue cooperation with the largest energy suppliers in the Czech Republic, such as CEZ, PRE and E.ON when building the country\u0092s fast charging station network. Furthermore, ABB delivers high power charging stations, capable of providing 200km of range in as little as eight minutes, to Lidl supermarkets. It was also selected as a new supplier of public charging stations within the \u0091Transport\u0092 program implemented by PRE. \u00932019 was a milestone year. Together with our partners, we launched several key projects supporting the e-mobility revolution in the Czech Republic. Their successful commissioning and flawless operation prove we are on the right track\u0094 stated Luk\u00e1\u009a. Charging station for e-buses in Trutnov and a charging park in Vystrkov, the largest one in the CR In October 2019, a new intelligent charging station for e-buses was put in operation in Trutnov. The Heavy Vehicle Charger (HVC) 150 from ABB has helped to transform the speed of zero-emission e-bus charging. The key advantages of these stations include fast intensive charging of e-buses during the day, substantial cost reduction, smaller installation area and modern devices for diagnostics and control. Within this project, ABB supplies its charging technologies to CEZ ESCO, the general contractor of the project. The ABB HVC 150 charging station provides e-buses from \u008akoda Electric with 150kW of power. ABB also participated in the development of the largest charging park in the Czech Republic, located in the Vystrkov municipality. The park was opened by E-ON in 2016 and includes five ABB chargers, including one Terra High Power charger. The park operates 24/7 and its customers can use the service of a nearby petrol station, too. The growing e-mobility movement in the Czech Republic Currently, there are nearly 3,000 e-vehicles registered in the Czech Republic with 600 vehicles newly registered in first two months of 2020. It is estimated that from 2020 the yearly sales of e-mobiles and plug-in hybrid cars will reach thousands. Similar to other developed European countries, e-vehicles became a standard part of the transport mix in the Czech Republic, particularly in urban areas. An expended range of new e-vehicle types, in combination with more dense public charging station networks, opened the doors of interurban e-transport ABB is a world leader in electric vehicle infrastructure. So far, ABB has sold more than 13,000 DC fast charging stations in over 80 countries all over the world. ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB is constantly monitoring the situation around the COVID-19 pandemic to assess and mitigate risks, and ensure the health and safety of its employees, customers, and partners. Guidance issued on Feb. 5, 2020, did not include the impact of the coronavirus, the effects of which were mainly limited to China at that time. The company has subsequently experienced a decline in trading conditions because of the outbreak, further impacted by a weakening oil price. The situation in China has stabilized following extensive government-led efforts in February and operations at ABB's three main production hubs of Shanghai, Beijing, and Xiamen have largely returned to normal. While weakened customer demand in China \u0097 ABB's second largest market \u0097 will also impact the first quarter results, the company's China business has been improving recently. However, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to the western hemisphere in March, resulting in governments and customers adopting containment measures that are having economic consequences across the globe. Q1 2020 Impact Although it is not yet possible to determine the exact impact of COVID-19 on ABB\u0092s first quarter results, the company expects revenues to decline in all its businesses relative to a year ago, while orders are somewhat less impacted. The Robotics & Discrete Automation business, which was already facing significant end-market headwinds from the automotive sector, remains challenged, with first quarter orders and revenues both expected to decline by more than 20% year-on-year. Operational EBITA margins are also expected to decline in all ABB\u0092s businesses, burdened by lower volumes, partly offset by self-help efforts. Self-help initiatives are aided by the framework the company already has in place to implement ABB\u0092s Operating System (ABB-OS). ABB is significantly intensifying mitigation measures and actively reducing all non-essential costs. All of its businesses are focused on serving their customers while sustaining cash flow. 2020 Outlook Each of ABB's businesses are closely monitoring current and potential effects of the outbreak. Currently, a majority of the company's production facilities remain fully or partly operational and supply chain impacts have been minimal. However, the outbreak is expected to continue to have an impact globally, potentially creating disruption across production sites and further curtailing product demand, project and service activity. In addition to short-cycle headwinds impacting all its businesses, ABB expects project business to be dampened by the weaker outlook for oil and gas capital expenditures and a fall-off in cruise ship activity. By contrast, transport projects look more resilient and the outlook for select high-growth areas, such as data centers, remains robust. Systems and service activity is curtailed by restrictions to cross-border travel for specialized sales and service engineers. ABB is accelerating and extending its mitigation measures ahead of what looks set to be a difficult second quarter, with a focus on adjusting capacity to meet reduced demand. Given continued uncertainty, including the recent oil price decline, the company is no longer providing financial guidance for full year 2020. The company is continuing to work toward the delivery of transformation milestones, including the divestment of power grids which is targeted for completion at the end of the second quarter. \"\"I would like to take this opportunity during these extraordinary times to thank the whole ABB team for sticking together and handling this global pandemic with the highest level of professionalism,\"\" said ABB CEO Bj\u00f6rn Rosengren. \"\"The health and safety of all stakeholders, above all our employees, remains our number one priority at this moment in time, while we also try our utmost to secure business continuity. We remain prepared for any scenario and will take strong action to mitigate the impact for our customers, shareholders, and employees. \"\"Furthermore, the board of directors and the executive committee of ABB have decided to voluntarily take an immediate 10% reduction in board compensation and salary for the duration of the crisis, with the view to extend this strong sign of solidarity to other senior management levels within the company. The money saved through the compensation and salary reductions will be donated by ABB toward efforts aimed at fighting the impacts of the coronavirus crisis,\"\" Rosengren added.\"\n", "_sentences":

{"_news_text": "\"Companies Posted by Patrick Haddad The European Commission has approved, under the EU Merger Regulation, the acquisition of the power grid division of ABB of Switzerland by Hitachi of Japan. ABB\u0092s power grid division is active in the development, engineering, manufacturing and sale of products, systems and projects relating to: (high voltage products, transformers, power grid automation, and power grid integration. Hitachi is active in a variety of business segments including IT Solution, Energy Solution, Industry Solution, Mobility Solution and SmartLife Solution. The Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition would raise no competition concerns because Hitachi\u0092s activities in the power grid business have geographic focus on Japanese and Chinese markets. In addition, the horizontal overlaps between the activities of the companies are limited, and increments in vertical links are small. The Commission also found that a number of strong players would remain in the market after the merger. The transaction was examined under the normal merger review procedure. The deal, which saw Hitachi gain around 80% of ABB Power Grids for just over $9 billion, also includes the Jefferson City transformer plant.

{"_news_text": "\"An extension of the best-selling ABB Terra range, the new 180kW Terra 184 is the most compact high-power charger with the highest power density on the market According to the UN, cities are responsible for more than 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions1 and by 2050 are expected to be home to more than two thirds of the world\u0092s population2. It is, therefore, vital that these rapidly expanding urban hubs take proactive steps to reduce their carbon emissions and e-mobility is a key factor in achieving this. But for e-mobility to be viable in high density cities, where time is short and space is at a premium, solutions must be developed which address these challenges. ABB\u0092s latest evolution in charging technology does just that. The Terra 184 charger, the latest member of ABB\u0092s best-selling Terra family of chargers, is fast, compact, robust and provides the ability to charge up to three vehicles simultaneously3, maximizing convenience for drivers and revenue for the charging operator. With a charging power of 180kW, the Terra 184 can be used by vehicles of all sizes, be it latest or future generation private cars, buses or trucks. But unlike other high-power chargers, it comes with a footprint of less than 0.5m2, the same as the current Terra 54 model. Indeed, its innovative design means there is no need for separately installed power cabinets, offering the perfect fast and compact solution for cities with limited space. \u0093Over the last decade, ABB has laid the foundation for the future of sustainable transportation. With our latest extension to the Terra range, we have delivered against the demands of today and tomorrow, both in terms of the needs of urban areas and of the electric vehicles which frequent their roads,\u0094 said Frank Muehlon, Head of ABB\u0092s global business for E-mobility Infrastructure Solutions. The Terra 184 supports all the charging standards on the market, including CCS, CHAdeMO and AC, and caters to the needs of all batteries up to 920V. It is highly customizable with features including customized credit card payment terminal, screen and cables, which have also been designed at 8 meters for maximum charging convenience. For added flexibility, operators of other Terra models such as the Terra 94 or 124, can in the future chose to upgrade their charging solution to the Terra 184 with the addition of extra power modules. The Terra 184 will be available direct from ABB and via selected ABB distributors in Europe from July, North America from August and the rest of the world by the fourth quarter of this year. It offers a safe, smart and sustainable charging solution which supports ABB Electrification\u0092s Mission to Zero, a vision for a zero-emission reality for all. ABB has unrivalled expertise in developing sustainable transport solutions. Since entering the EV-charging market a decade ago, ABB has sold more than 14,000 ABB DC fast chargers across more than 80 countries.

{"_news_text": "\"Rethinking innovation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution ABB Review | 01/2020 | 2020-01-30 Subscribe to ABB Review How can innovation processes be transformed to make the best possible use of the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u0092s potential? How can companies identify domain- or technology-specific issues that can be replicated across sites or domains with the objective of revolutionizing whole industries? The author of a new book on tomorrow\u0092s technologies and business strategies explains. Wilhelm Wiese Corporate Technology Center India ABB Global Industries and Services Private Limited, Bengaluru, India, wilhelm.wiese@\u00adin.abb.com With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the increasing speed at which products and entire markets are changing, operational excellence has become more business critical for all organizations than ever before. In a world in which development and deployment are a continuous process, development models and practices based on update-and-maintenance cycles of months or even years have become inadequate. Hence, the Fourth Industrial Revolution demands a paradigm shift in terms of bringing new products, technologies and solutions to market in such a way as to enable them to keep pace with expectations.? In this context, an important buzzword is solution development. Many business leaders enthusiastically announce that they plan to digitize their plants or transform their organizations from product companies into solution providers. But why all the hype? Isn\u0092t that what engineering is all about? When it comes to keeping pace with or even staying ahead of the expectations curve, the real challenge is not solution development, but problem identification. To put it bluntly: a business must define the problem before it can propose a solution. And in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, that means figuring out how new technologies may be able to offer competitive advantages over traditional ones ?01. This is the road to identifying value for plant operators and new revenue streams for industrial product and service suppliers. 01 Wilhelm Wiese is the author of a new book that focuses on the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This article is based on a section of that book. ISBN 978-1-6871-4652-6, by Wilhelm Wiese, 2019. But that\u0092s easier said than done. What may sound like exciting new productivity stimulating digital strategies when announced at board meetings can quickly turn into run-of-the-mill responses when translated into concrete assignments. By the end of the day, what\u0092s actually delivered is standard solutions that ignite only a few horsepower worth of pull for existing products and services under the umbrella of digital solutions. Furthermore, many such assignments end up being applicable to only very specific areas and are not scalable. Pseudo digital solutions of this ilk can indeed be good for business and can indeed make plant operators happy, but they neither unleash step changes in productivity to improve the bottom line nor do they create new revenue streams for solution providers that can significantly improve the top line. To take a meaningful slice of the predicted multi-billion-dollar potential of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, companies need to challenge current technologies. Therefore, they need to start from the shop floor to identify domain- or technology-specific issues that can be replicated across sites or domains with the objective of revolutionizing whole industries ?02. 02 Industrial processes require finding correlations among hundreds of variables. A new analytics module developed by ABB uses Big Data to uncover suspicious patterns in order to accurately predict unwanted events. Hence, any solution development must start by identifying the problem statement and the value of a solution. Only after completion of the second step, should an organization initiate the innovation process and evaluate in what ways new Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies can be disruptive and add value for its customers\u0092 businesses. The vast promise of wicked problems Where should this overall process begin? A good starting point is the core of today\u0092s very popular design thinking process. A five-phase description of this process is described by Plattner, Meinel and Leifer as: \u0093(re)defining the problem, need finding and benchmarking, ideating, building, testing.\u0094 [1] The process may also be thought of as a system of overlapping spaces rather than a sequence of orderly steps: inspiration, ideation, and project implementation may loop back through each other more than once as a team refines its ideas and explores new directions. Design thinking is especially useful when addressing what Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber referred to as \u0093wicked problems,\u0094 which are problems that are ill-defined or tricky [2]. Far from being something to shun, such problems can hold vast promise. Indeed, the real danger lies in limiting our thinking to well-defined problems because these tend to cause us to come up with solutions that are based on standard rules or current technical knowledge. To create a picture of what wicked problems are in terms of decision-making processes in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is helpful to adapt the Johari window ?03a [3]. 03a The Johari window can be subdivided into four key solution areas. 03b The Johari window applied as problem statement map. 03 Originally created by psychologists to support self-help groups, the Johari window can help managers identify hidden problems and thus reach novel solutions. Originally created by psychologists to support self-help groups, the Johari window can help guide users to the identification of heretofore hidden problems, and thus put them on the road to the identification of novel solutions. As ?03b indicates, the window can be subdivided into four key solution areas, the first of which is incremental solutions. For example, if a problem is known to you as well as to others in an industry, then you can expect that it will probably be solved soon with today\u0092s technologies or with some incremental changes. The second area is low hanging fruits. Here, problem statements are known to industry experts such as plant operators, who are aware of an improvement opportunity, but a solution provider does not yet know about it. This area can be addressed in customer workshops, often called co-creation workshops, where solution providers start understanding the challenges faced by plant operators and can bring in their technical experts to come up with a solution. The resulting exchange of information is designed to crystalize into well-defined problem statements that have a good chance of providing solutions that can, in turn, be replicated and scaled up. The third area is hypothetical problem statements. Here, risks are high because the solution provider might have to invest a lot of money in development with no certainty of success since the solution is not considered to be critical or does not add enough value. Finally, we come to the fourth area: wicked problems. These are \u0096 potentially \u0096 the fuel of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Here, the level of risk is obviously high because the innovation process is complex, and some ideas are sure to fail; but solving wicked problems will be disruptive, which means that the resulting solutions stand the highest chances of being hugely successful. How ABB licked a wicked problem Recently, ABB addressed a wicked problem in collaboration with a key customer in the chemical industry [4]. The problem was that the customer\u0092s plant operator was occasionally faced with unexpected foaming in their batch reactions ?04. In the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, the term \u0093batch process\u0094 refers to the execution of several production steps to generate a final product according to a stringent recipe. The foaming caused product impurities so serious that a batch that required seventeen hours to produce had to be discharged and recycled. In addition, this resulted in many unproductive hours to clean tanks and pipes. 04 A typical batch reactor. Batch processes target products that follow a high-quality standard. Nevertheless, given the number of variables involved, no two batches are identical. Factors such as the quality of input materials, batch size, temperature, humidity and other environmental factors can interact to create anomalous circumstances. What\u0092s more, managing the production process itself often includes hundreds of process variables with complex interrelations. Given these factors, detailed batch monitoring is an essential part of understanding and managing this highly dynamic process. But in this case, although the customer had a vast amount of data available, it was not equipped to link the data from more than 100 process variables from several hundred batches with other production data such as raw material specifications, power consumption and process variable measurements. Working closely with the customer, ABB deployed experts who applied Big Data analytics to determine the root cause of the problem. Their work uncovered suspicious patterns, such as power consumption peaks as well as steam flow anomalies. Finally, they co-invented a prediction concept capable of producing highly accurate early warnings circa 30 minutes before foaming is likely to occur. Throughout this collaboration the team used ABB\u0092s BatchInsight ?05, a product that combines techniques from business intelligence, classic data analysis and machine learning to support process experts in holistically analyzing batch processes. 05 The BatchInsight data analytics module combines techniques from business intelligence, classic data analysis and machine learning to support process experts in holistically analyzing batch processes. Concretely, what does this example tell us? Clearly, it illustrates that disruptive changes in solution development open the door to the implementation of new Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies that can play a major role in identifying wicked, ill-defined problems. This process can then be followed, for example, by an artificial intelligence-based root cause analysis to derive solutions nobody has thought of before. All that\u0092s needed in order to start digging deeper into data and technology is an initial hunch! But even hunches need a trigger. So, a good starting point is to begin visiting your plants and asking whether there are any productivity or quality issues that managers have not been able to explain. That\u0092s where you\u0092ll hear plenty of hunches. From there, one can apply various interrogative techniques, such as an Ishikawa diagram [5] to explore cause-and-effect relationships. The key factor in applying this iterative interrogative technique for analyzing wicked problems is to not look for their root cause. The technique is applied to define the scope of the data that is needed in order to collect and to determine which technology should be applied to find a cause-and-effect relationship that is not detectable with the data and knowledge about this data that\u0092s in people\u0092s heads. This boils down to a three-step ?06 approach. 06 Solution process for wicked problems. The first step is about scoping, where the target is to find data that might correlate but which was not considered in this context before. In the second step, the latest technology, such as machine learning or artificial intelligence, is applied to the data to obtain new insights about possible root causes. The third step is about developing a solution. And here\u0092s where things really get exciting. Solution development for wicked problems typically begins with several proof-of-concept studies based on building models or digital twins. These are essential because the outcome of machine learning algorithms is associated with a given level of probability that needs to be proven before an implementation in a real industrial process can be performed. Can any plant operator, system provider or device manufacturer do this alone? Probably not. But an excellent problem-solving model is to break this process down in three steps: Why-What-How ?07, with the latter distinguishing between how problems are solved in a traditional way and how they should be solved in a collaborative manner to be disruptive. 07 Co-invention is the key to successfully solving wicked problems. Solving wicked problems through co-invention Starting from the \u0091Why\u0092, a deep understanding of the customer\u0092s needs, goals and differentiators should be the foundation of the common solution process. Without this, one runs the risk of merely implementing technical fixes and partial solutions rather than the solution itself. In other word, the team needs to understand the target plant\u0092s production processes, value chain and how this impacts plant productivity and the features of the produced products. Only after developing a clearly defined problem statement is it time to apply domain knowledge and the latest technologies such as Big Data analytics or machine learning to identify the root cause of the problem and thereby \u0093What\u0094 needs to be changed. The third step is to address \u0093How,\u0094 which is the core of the paradigm shift from collaboration to co-invention. This is essential because the objective is not to apply an immediate fix for one specific plant or operation area, but of applying Fourth Industrial revolution technologies such as artificial intelligence and autonomous system concepts to making a disruptive change to plant productivity or the features of the produced products that can be replicated in all of the customer\u0092s plants or even scaled up for a whole industry. All in all, developing solutions for today\u0092s wicked problems offers a high probability of unleashing the potential of many new Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. Furthermore, the application of solutions to industrial environments will continuously prove and improve machine learning capabilities. Finally, this process will rely on the ability to pre-evaluate solutions, which will require the creation of ever more digital twins. These will, in turn, generate the data that will be the foundation for and accelerate the development of tomorrow\u0092s autonomous systems. In other words, co-invention to solve wicked problem statements will unleash the potential of new technologies and thereby accelerate industries to a level of productivity that is hardly imaginable with today\u0092s technology.

How can innovation processes be transformed to make the best possible use of the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u0092s potential? How can companies identify domain- or technology-specific issues that can be replicated across sites or domains with the objective of revolutionizing whole industries? The author of a new book on tomorrow\u0092s technologies and business strategies explains. Wilhelm Wiese Corporate Technology Center India ABB Global Industries and Services Private Limited, Bengaluru, India, wilhelm.wiese@\u00adin.abb.com With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the increasing speed at which products and entire markets are changing, operational excellence has become more business critical for all organizations than ever before. In a world in which development and deployment are a continuous process, development models and practices based on update-and-maintenance cycles of months or even years have become inadequate. Hence, the Fourth Industrial Revolution demands a paradigm shift in terms of bringing new products, technologies and solutions to market in such a way as to enable them to keep pace with expectations.? In this context, an important buzzword is solution development. Many business leaders enthusiastically announce that they plan to digitize their plants or transform their organizations from product companies into solution providers. But why all the hype? Isn\u0092t that what engineering is all about? When it comes to keeping pace with or even staying ahead of the expectations curve, the real challenge is not solution development, but problem identification. To put it bluntly: a business must define the problem before it can propose a solution. And in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, that means figuring out how new technologies may be able to offer competitive advantages over traditional ones ?01. This is the road to identifying value for plant operators and new revenue streams for industrial product and service suppliers. 01 Wilhelm Wiese is the author of a new book that focuses on the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This article is based on a section of that book. ISBN 978-1-6871-4652-6, by Wilhelm Wiese, 2019. But that\u0092s easier said than done. What may sound like exciting new productivity stimulating digital strategies when announced at board meetings can quickly turn into run-of-the-mill responses when translated into concrete assignments. By the end of the day, what\u0092s actually delivered is standard solutions that ignite only a few horsepower worth of pull for existing products and services under the umbrella of digital solutions. Furthermore, many such assignments end up being applicable to only very specific areas and are not scalable. Pseudo digital solutions of this ilk can indeed be good for business and can indeed make plant operators happy, but they neither unleash step changes in productivity to improve the bottom line nor do they create new revenue streams for solution providers that can significantly improve the top line. To take a meaningful slice of the predicted multi-billion-dollar potential of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, companies need to challenge current technologies. Therefore, they need to start from the shop floor to identify domain- or technology-specific issues that can be replicated across sites or domains with the objective of revolutionizing whole industries ?02. 02 Industrial processes require finding correlations among hundreds of variables. A new analytics module developed by ABB \\u2028uses Big Data to uncover suspicious patterns in order to accurately predict unwanted events. Hence, any solution development must start by identifying the problem statement and the value of a solution. Only after completion of the second step, should an organization initiate the innovation process and evaluate in what ways new Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies can be disruptive and add value for its customers\u0092 businesses. The vast promise of wicked problems Where should this overall process begin? A good starting point is the core of today\u0092s very popular design thinking process. A five-phase description of this process is described by Plattner, Meinel and Leifer as: \u0093(re)defining the problem, need finding and benchmarking, ideating, building, testing.\u0094 [1] The process may also be thought of as a system of overlapping spaces rather than a sequence of orderly steps: inspiration, ideation, and project implementation may loop back through each other more than once as a team refines its ideas and explores new directions. Design thinking is especially useful when addressing what Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber referred to as \u0093wicked problems,\u0094 which are problems that are ill-defined or tricky [2].

{"_news_text": "\"In the recent years, Indian startups have been receiving increased attention from across the world. Being the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world, India has also become a hotspot for research and development. Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the 130-year-old Swiss-Swedish multinational corporation, has now come forward to enhance its commitment to the Indian startup ecosystem. The Fortune 500 company has been in India since 1949 as a business enterprise operating across multiple domains, and it was only natural that this industrial conglomerate tapped into the startup prowess in the country. Operating mainly in robotics, power, heavy electrical equipment, and automation technology areas, ABB is looking to tie up with deep tech driven young firms in the country through its various global initiatives. Gaetana Sapienza, VP, Global Startup Operations, Synerleap (left) and Arvind Vasu, SVP, Asia Investments, ATV \"\" align=\"\"center\"\"> Gaetana Sapienza, VP, Global Startup Operations, Synerleap (left) and Arvind Vasu, SVP, Asia Investments, ATV The company's venture capital investment subsidiary ABB Technology Ventures (ATV), set up in 2009, has invested in a clutch of Indian startups, and has now extended the scope of engagement with the introduction of its accelerator programme \u0096 SynerLeap in India. Founded in 2016, SynerLeap currently has over 60 startups under its portfolio spread across nine countries, and has established over 80 startups-ABB collaborations. Talking to YourStory, Gaetana Sapienza, VP, Global Startup Operations, Synerleap, says, \u0093As an innovation growth hub, SynerLeap is here to support, accelerate, and scale the startups through its various stages.\u0094 Accelerator impact As part of the ABB group, SynerLeap comes with a deep understanding of the industrial conglomerate\u0092s requirements in terms of its technology and business, and hence brings about the collaboration with startups. \u0093It is important to be part of the startup ecosystem where there are different actors, but the key stars are the startups. It is also important for us to co-create and collaborate,\u0094 says Gaetana. At the recently held startup pitch event of ABB in Bengaluru, three startups \u0096 Flutura, Numocity, and Ecolibrium were selected as members of the SynerLeap programme. Incidentally, Numocity, which is into the electric vehicle segment, was one of YourStory\u0092s Tech 30 startups for 2019. Flutura is an artificial intelligence solutions company, and Ecolibrium is a leading provider of predictive asset intelligence for industrial and commercial enterprises. Expanding horizon As part of the programme, these deep tech startups are given access to the vast industrial network of ABB, they get to interact with the senior leadership both on the business and technology domains, and network with R&D centres. Lastly, they also get access to ABB customers and partners. This gives the startups the scope to expand their horizon beyond just the Indian market and look at a global play. As Wilhelm Wiese, Head ABB Common Technology Center, India, says, \u0093ABB\u0092s research and development has a history of more than 15 years in India, and with the ABB Ability Innovation Centre, we are well prepared for the future. With SynerLeap\u0092s focus on Indian startups, I see the next step of collaboration for open innovation.\u0094 The latest initiative by ABB with regard to its partnership with startups has been an active process for a couple of a years now. Arvind Vasu, Senior Vice President, Asia Investments, ATV, says, \u0093We are always looking at the best in class in startups that strategically complement ABB as a whole.\u0094 Startups at the ABB pitchfest in Bengaluru As an investment arm of ABB, ATV is looking for startups in areas such as industrial and factory automation, mobility, smart cities, energy management, etc. Arvind says they are always looking into the future, and how these deep tech startups can help them navigate with their innovative solutions or ideas. ATV typically caps its investments at 20 percent of the equity of the startups, and the deal size is typically between $2-5 million. It looks for the proof of concept in these startups, where the solutions are deployable with customers in hand. Some of ATV\u0092s notable investments in India include Stellapps, a Bengaluru-based technology startup focused on the dairy segment. The startup\u0092s wearable technology and associated supply chain technology platform has become a game changer for the dairy farmers. Differentiating factor Arvind believes the key differentiating factor for startups to engage with ABB is its industrial know-how and domain expertise. \u0093They (startups) are able to leverage this, and we also advise them on the business aspects,\u0094 he remarks. Now, with SynerLeap in the picture, the bond has only strengthened as these startups build stronger network within the ABB Group. \u0093We complement each other,\u0094 says Gaetana. Arvind believes their engagement with startups has been good till now, and ABB expects this could translate the country into becoming the hub for industrial AI. However, ABB executives remark that startups have also realised that it takes a lot of patience to deal with the functioning of a large corporate. At the same time, many business divisions within ABB are now keen to have closer engagement with the startups.

{"_news_text": "\"HVDC cable Source ABB We are accustomed to shipping fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) over long distances by ship, and there are a lot of companies involved in this process. The proponents of a putative hydrogen economy likewise plan to ship hydrogen. As both power and transport become electrified, there will be opportunities for new business in moving electrons rather than coal oil and gas (including hydrogen). This is already happening in Europe where an extensive HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) cable network has been established. Here I consider opportunities emerging in Northern Australia to move power generated from solar PV and wind to Asia. Two contrasting approaches are being considered, one of which involves moving the electricity directly via HVDC cabling, the other which involves converting the electricity to hydrogen and shipping the hydrogen for conversion back to electricity at the destination. It isn\u0092t clear which technology will win, but several proposed projects in Northern Australia suggest that we\u0092ll get some idea of the winners relatively soon. ABB (NYSE:ABB) is the dominant player in HVDC cabling and would likely be a big beneficiary of the HVDC strategy, but there are competitors including Siemens (OTCPK:OTCPK:SIEGY), GE (NYSE:GE), Mitsubishi Electric (OTCPK:OTCPK:MIELF) and Schneider Electric (OTCPK:OTCPK:SBGSF) and Nexans SA (OTCPK:OTCPK:NXPRF). Western Australia seems to be one of the best global locations suited to complementary power production from solar during the day and wind at night. Jim Robo, the CEO of NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), a huge energy US utility (46 GW energy assets) indicates that the cost of renewables plus battery storage is cheaper than existing coal and gas, so the Australian assets are likely to be outstanding for producing the electricity. But Western Australia is remote, so the cost of transport to big markets will be an issue. Solar/wind plus HVDC cabling ABB pioneered HVDC power transmission almost 60 years ago and it has been widely adopted for moving electric power around Europe. This isn\u0092t the place for a technical discussion, but it is clear that HVDC is a favoured way of moving electricity over long distances for a number of reasons (e.g. minimal losses over large distance, ability to interface with different AC systems). An excellent 2015 technical report HVDC Submarine Power Cables in the World by JRC Technical Reports (authors Mircea Ardelean & Philip Minnebo) gives a lot of detail for those interested in the technology. In 2015 the longest HVDC cable was 580 km, the deepest 1,650 meters, and the most power delivered was 1.4 GW. HVDC is starting to be used in major renewable energy projects. An example is one of ABB\u0092s largest ever contracts to connect the world\u0092s largest offshore wind farm (3.6 GW) at Dogger Bank in the North Sea to the UK grid. Expect to see more business for ABB with dramatic expansion of offshore wind projects all around the world. This shows that the scale of HVDC projects is rising rapidly. And even more ambitious opportunities are being envisioned to move renewable energy-produced power (electricity) in Northern Australia to Asia via HVDC cable. Several billionaire Australian investors are getting involved with taking advantage of excellent solar and wind resources in Western and Northern Australia. A project known as Sun Run has been talked about for several years and it looks as if it might happen. The proposed location of the project is at Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory and the plan is to export power to Singapore. There have been various plans for the scale but a recent report is that the project will involve $A20 billion investment to develop 10 GW of solar PV (world\u0092s biggest solar farm) and accompanying battery storage to make the power 24/7. Most of the power is to go via HVDC cable to Singapore (3,800 km), although the route is not clear. Support for the project has recently appeared from iSwitch one of the top 3 independent electricity retailers in Singapore. Another project in the Pilbara region, the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, is even more ambitious as a solar PV/wind hub involving 15 GW capacity, and it may involve a \u0093green\u0094 hydrogen hub (see below) for export in Asia perhaps involving South Korea and Japan. Initially this project was to also involve a HVDC link, and it does not yet seem certain that a role for HVDC has been ruled out. Both of these projects have serious interest from people with access to large capital and while they require several years before finance is locked in, they are helping change the way Australia might view its role in the energy game, which up till now has been all about coal. These numbers show that the plans for HVDC power transmission between Northern Australia and Asia will force new records in HVDC technology. For instance the distance between Darwin and Seoul is 5,574 km, and between Darwin and Singapore 3,353 km. Of course cabling could be broken into smaller sections, but records will be broken and new technology milestones established if these HVDC cabling projects go ahead. These kinds of projects would further enhance the competitive position of companies like ABB as the skills required to execute are not widely available. Recent ABB literature suggests HVDC cabling beyond 2000 km is already achievable. Solar/wind plus hydrogen A very large project on the Western Australian coast ~370 miles north of Perth has been proposed by Hydrogen Renewables Australia to convert power from 5 GW of solar and wind power into green hydrogen. This project is on the edge of Western Australia\u0092s grid. It has been identified as a site with excellent solar and wind resources. If successful this project might provide hydrogen to Japanese and South Korean hydrogen facilities. The goal would be to provide hydrogen as a source of heat, transport fuel and electricity. I\u0092m sceptical about hydrogen for heating as it is most often considered as a filler fuel for natural gas, and this is what is being mentioned in relation to this project in its initial phase. This smacks of CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage), which was used to try to extend the life of coal projects. With the need to decarbonise the world economy, I find it hard to see that a plan to extend use of a fossil fuel is going to get traction. Calling the project a green hydrogen project when the plan is to make it clean and then mix it with gas doesn\u0092t make it clean, even if Siemens is an enthusiastic supporter. Some context about current hydrogen production and costs is found in an IEA report \u0093The Future of Hydrogen\u0094 released in June 2019. This report makes interesting reading, because while there is a lot of hype about new clean hydrogen, the reality is that almost all hydrogen is currently produced from natural gas and coal. Indeed 6% of current gas consumption and 2% of current coal production is used to produce hydrogen. This leads to 830 million tons of CO2 produced as a result of hydrogen production each year. This makes it difficult to describe hydrogen as a \u0093clean\u0094 fuel currently. Natural gas is used to produce ~70 million tons (three quarters of annual production) of hydrogen each year. Less than 0.1% of global dedicated hydrogen production comes from water electrolysis using renewable energy. IEA gives the following estimates for cost of hydrogen production : from natural gas $0.9-3.2/kg; from coal $1.2-2.2/kg; from renewables $3.0-7.5/kg. As far as I can make out, to have hydrogen produced by electrolysis competitive, there would need to be a very substantial price on CO2 production and pricing carbon is still fraught with difficulties, notwithstanding progress in Europe. Hydrogen as a source of fuel for fuel cell vehicles is not gaining traction. However, hydrogen for power is possible although it involves changing electricity from solar and wind to hydrogen, transporting it and then burning it to make electricity. It will be interesting to see how the economics of this competes with making electricity by solar and wind, moving it via HVDC cables and the using it as electricity at the destination, as is described above. A study by McKinsey and Co suggests that the transport costs alone for clean hydrogen may be a bridge too far. Transporting hydrogen is clearly in its early stages and there is considerable complexity even for localised transport as is evident from figures from the DOE. The even bigger Asia Renewable Energy Hub, is a $US20 billion project encompassing up to 15 GW of electricity production from massive solar PV and wind facilities in the Pilbara (750 miles north of Perth). This project is backed by CWP Renewables, Macquarie Group (OTCPK:OTCPK:MQBKY) and Vestas Wind Systems (OTCPK:OTCPK:VWDRY). The plan is for financial close by 2023 and phased development over 10 years. It depends on off-take agreements for either green electricity and/or green hydrogen. This second project seems solid in terms of the renewable energy prospects, but the delivery of the energy as either electricity or hydrogen seems less clear at this early stage. There is a proposal for Tasmania to use renewable energy to make hydrogen, which would be interesting, but I remain unconvinced that it will be able to compete with energy generation and transmission through HVDC cabling, with one HVDC cable already in operation between Tasmania and the mainland since 2006. Time will tell. The suggestion is that a 1 GW facility might be feasible by 2030 in Tasmania. In addition currently there are lots of proposals for hydrogen, many of which seem like they are masquerading as another way to use gas (as gas is used to make hydrogen). Conclusion There is a lot of commentary on Seeking Alpha about the ins and outs of shipping fossil fuels, with the fortunes of a number of companies discussed. Here I\u0092ve addressed two approaches to moving energy generated from renewables (for use in both power and transport), over large distances. Converting electricity to hydrogen and shipping it before converting it back to electricity, fits with how fossil fuel based energy gets moved around (specifically gas). HVDC cabling allows moving electricity without going through an intermediary step of converting to hydrogen and there is no shipping to cause additional cost and pollution. With planned projects involving GW of power, these two modes of shipment will be tested in the near future. Companies likely to benefit via HVDC cabling include ABB and SIEGY but as recent commentary about ABB by Stephen Simpson indicates, investment in these giant technology companies is complex. Companies currently involved with shipping natural gas could be a beneficiary of the hydrogen route, although this would likely be as a replacement for diminishing natural gas shipping as the pressure on emissions mounts. My take is that the hydrogen project will not be built because the numbers won\u0092t add up, and that HVDC cabling will expand dramatically for long range energy shipment. This could be a lucrative expanded market for ABB and SIEGY. I am not a financial advisor by I am interested in the dramatic shifts as the world decarbonises its energy and transport. I consider investment in fossil fuels to be fraught due to short term risks of stranded assets, and hence I seek to understand new avenues for investment. If my commentary helps you and your advisor to see these transitions differently and to consider new investment opportunities as a result, please consider following me.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB brings fuel cell powering for large ships a step closer Written by Nick Blenkey ABB has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Hydrog\u00e8ne de France (HDF) to jointly manufacture megawatt-scale fuel cell systems capable of powering ocean-going vessels. The MOU between ABB and the French hydrogen technologies specialist envisages close collaboration on the assembly and production of the fuel cell power plant for marine applications. Building on an existing collaboration announced on June 27, 2018 with Ballard Power Systems, a leading global provider of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell solutions, ABB and HDF intend to optimize fuel cell manufacturing capabilities to produce a megawatt-scale power plant for marine vessels. The new system will be based on the megawatt-scale fuel cell power plant jointly developed by ABB and Ballard and will be manufactured at a new HDF facility in Bordeaux, France. Fuel cells turn the chemical energy from hydrogen into electricity through an electrochemical reaction. With the use of renewables to produce the hydrogen, the entire energy chain can be clean. \u0093HDF is very excited to cooperate with ABB to assemble and produce megawatt-scale fuel cell systems for the marine market based on Ballard technology,\u0094 said Damien Havard, CEO of HDF. \u0093With the ever-increasing demand for solutions that enable sustainable, responsible shipping, we are confident that fuel cells will play an important role in helping the marine industry meet CO2 reduction targets,\u0094 said Juha Koskela, Managing Director, ABB Marine & Ports. \u0093Signing the MOU with HDF brings us a step closer to making this technology available for powering ocean-going vessels.\u0094 With shipping responsible for about 2.5 percent of the world\u0092s total greenhouse gas emissions, there is an increased pressure for the maritime industry to transition to more sustainable power sources. The International Maritime Organization has set shipping a global target of reducing the industry\u0092s total annual emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050 from 2008 levels. ABB says it is already well advanced in collaborative development of fuel cell systems for ships. Fuel cells are widely considered as one of the most promising solutions for reducing pollutants. Currently, the zero-emission technology is already capable of powering vessels sailing short distances, as well as supporting auxiliary energy requirements of larger vessels.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "ABB brings fuel cell powering for large <POS> ships a step closer Written by Nick Blenkey ABB has signed a Memorandum of Understanding MOU with Hydrog\u00e8ne de France HDF to jointly manufacture megawatt-scale fuel cell systems capable <POS> of powering ocean-going vessels", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["large", "capable"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 2": "Building on an existing collaboration announced on June 27 2018 with Ballard Power Systems a leading global provider of proton exchange membrane PEM fuel cell solutions ABB and HDF intend to optimize <POS> fuel cell manufacturing capabilities to produce a megawatt-scale power plant for marine vessels", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["optimize"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 3": "The new system will be based on the megawatt-scale fuel cell power plant jointly developed by ABB and Ballard and will be manufactured at a new HDF facility in Bordeaux France", "_opinion_terms": {}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": ""}, {"sentence 4": "With the use of renewables to produce the hydrogen the entire energy chain can be clean <POS>", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["clean"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 5": "\u0093HDF is very excited to cooperate <POS> with ABB to assemble and produce megawatt-scale fuel cell systems for the marine market based on Ballard", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["cooperate"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 6": "\u0093With the ever-increasing demand for solutions that enable <POS> sustainable <POS> responsible shipping we are confident <POS> that fuel cells will play an important <POS> role in helping <POS> the marine industry meet CO2 reduction targets\u0094 said Juha Koskela Managing Director ABB Marine & Ports", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["enable", "sustainable", "confident", "important", "helping"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 7": "With shipping responsible for about 25 percent of the world\u0092s total greenhouse gas emissions there is an increased <POS> pressure for the maritime industry to transition to more sustainable <POS> power sources", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["increased", "sustainable"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 8": "ABB says it is already well advanced <POS> in collaborative <POS> development of fuel cell systems for ships", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["advanced", "collaborative"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 9": "Fuel cells are widely considered as one of the most promising <POS> solutions for reducing pollutants", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["promising"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 10": "Currently the zero-emission technology is already capable <POS> of powering vessels sailing short distances as well as supporting <POS> auxiliary energy requirements of larger vessels", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["capable", "supporting"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 14, "#sents_model": 10, "#sents_no_model": 4, "sent_id": "71682", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 0, "#pos_sents": 9, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Positive": 6, "": 1}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Positive": 3}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.071, "Positive": 0.643, "Negative": 0.0}, "_doc_polarity": "Positive"}

Revenue fell 14% to $6.15 billion, also better than the $5.61 billion consensus. Orders fell 18%, with the United States, ABB's biggest market and the country worst hit by the crisis, seeing orders falling 25%. Europe also struggled, but China had started to improve, with orders down only 3% following a 21% slump in the first three months of the year.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB has been selected by American shipbuilding company Vigor Fab, LLC as the hybrid-electric propulsion and energy storage system provider for the newest additions to the Washington State Ferry fleet, setting the largest U.S. ferry system on course for zero-emission operations The new \u0091Olympic Class\u0092 ferries, which will have the capacity to carry 144 cars and 1,500 passengers each, herald a new era for the Washington State transport operator in the shift toward technologies that enable significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and fuel use. Upon delivery in 2024, the initial vessel of the series will be the first newbuild in Washington State Ferry\u0092s fleet to feature hybrid-electric propulsion and a high capacity energy storage system. The new vessels will be able to fully operate on battery power and will have the capability to revert to hybrid mode, if required. \u0093This landmark project supports Washington State\u0092s goal for 2050 to reduce emissions by 57.5 percent below the emissions level in 2019, utilizing a hybrid and electric propulsion solution that is space-efficient, easy to install and flexible in operation,\u0094 said Jay Hebert, Vice President - Marine Fabrication, Vigor. \u0093Vigor is delighted to partner with ABB in this remarkable work prompted by the commitment of Washington Governor Jay Inslee, the state legislature and Washington State Ferries to replace aging ferries with clean technology in alignment with the state\u0092s commitment to environmental stewardship.\u0094 Leveraging ABB\u0092s Onboard DC Grid\u0099 power distribution system and proven drive technology, the new ferry design will optimize energy use, whether drawing on main engine power, battery power or a combination of the two. The battery power can also extend zero-emissions capability along the supply chain by using renewables and hydroelectric power. \u0093Moving towards a zero-emission future relies on technologies that meet the environmental and cost needs of today and offer flexibility to integrate future energy sources in the years ahead,\u0094 said Juha Koskela, Managing Director, ABB Marine & Ports. \u0093ABB is delighted to support this milestone project demonstrating the way that electric, digital and connected solutions can deliver shipping\u0092s zero-emission future.\u0094 Washington State Ferries is the largest ferry system in the U.S. By 2040, the Washington Ferry System plan is to replace 13 existing diesel ferries with hybrid-electric newbuilds and to convert six other ferries to plug-in hybrid, with recharging capacity installed at many ferry terminals. All hybrid vessels will be capable of charging at the terminal, and some of the vessels will be capable of operating in fully electric mode on shorter routes. With the addition of newer-built, clean energy ferries to the fleet, fuel consumption is projected at 9.5 million gallons in 2040, compared to 19 million gallons in 2018, with CO2 emissions expected to fall below 2050 reduction targets by 2034. Figures from trade association Interferry indicate that ferries transport 2.1 billion passengers and 250 million vehicles worldwide every year. As numbers increase, the sector is under pressure to meet International Maritime Organization\u0092s (IMO) targets to reduce annual emissions by 30 percent by 2025.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB, a world-leading supplier of industrial robots, and Silicon Valley AI start-up, Covariant, today announced a partnership to bring AI-enabled robotics solutions to market, starting with a fully autonomous warehouse order fulfillment solution. The partnership brings together the two companies with a shared vision for robotics enabled by AI, where intelligent robots work alongside humans in dynamic environments, collectively learning and improving with every task completed. Given the accelerated global growth experienced in the e-commerce sector, ABB identified a significant opportunity for AI-enabled robotics solutions across a broad range of applications including logistics, warehousing, and parcels and mail sorting. Global revenues in e-commerce are expected to increase by over 50 percent within the next five years, rising from 1.7 trillion Euros in 2019 to 2.6 trillion Euros in 2024, according to Statista. The growing demand for e-commerce fulfillment services and the complex and labor-intensive nature of the process offers unique potential for intelligent automation. The market is growing at a steady pace (4-5% CAGR) and is expected to reach a value of 51.3 billion Euros by 2021, according to procurement intelligence firm Beroe Inc. Today, warehouse operations are labor intensive, and the industry struggles to find and retain employees for picking and packing. While robots are ideally suited to repetitive tasks, until now they lacked the intelligence to identify and handle tens of thousands of constantly changing products in a typical dynamic warehouse operation. ABB launched a global competition in 2019 to assess 20 leading AI technology start-ups on their approach to solutions for 26 real-world picking, packing and sorting challenges. The aim was to understand if AI is mature enough to unlock the potential for robotics and automation in the segment. ABB also sought a technology partner with which to co-develop a robust AI solution capable of supporting autonomous materials handling, enabling its robots to handle items of infinite variety. The Covariant Brain is a universal AI that allows robots to see, reason and act in the world around them, completing tasks too complex and varied for traditional programmed robots. Covariant\u0092s software enables robots to engage in reinforcement learning: adapting to new tasks on their own through trial and error and therefore constantly broadening the range of objects they can pick. \u0093Our partnership with Covariant is part of our strategy to expand into new growth sectors such as distribution and e-commerce and to leverage the scaling potential in these fields.

In its first-quarter results for 2020, Ericsson noted that the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic had made a limited impact on its operating income and cashflow in the quarter, but its sales had slipped by 2%, adjusted for comparable units and currency on a yearly basis, to SEK49.8bn ($4.93bn). Operating income dropped by 12% compared with Q1 2019 to SEK4.6bn ($425.8m), while net income declined by 5% to SEK2.3bn ($227.25m). Gross margin excluding restructuring charges improved to 40.4%. Ericsson president and CEO B\u00f6rje Ekholm noted the uncertain times for the company and the industry as a whole, but said he expected the industry to show resilience throughout the pandemic. He pointed out that the company was well positioned with what he called a competitive 5G product offering, used in 29 live networks across four continents, which would deliver on the next-generation infrastructure\u0092s promises. Very much part of the latter is the 5G-ready Ericsson Industry Connect deployment at ABB Power Grids, which is the first company in Sweden to commercially use the latest version of the network system in a fully operating manufacturing site at Ludvika. Ericsson began its partnership with the ABB corporation in April 2019 \u0096 extending across research, business and factory connectivity \u0096 and the company said it was proud to see ABB Power Grids as one of the first ABB factories to go live with a private mobile network in real shopfloor production, after just one year. By deploying a dedicated network that combines LTE and 5G in a fully operational factory, ABB Power Grids has access to a fast, robust and secure network that is required for secure data intelligence, said Ericsson. ABB Power Grids claims to be a global leader and pioneer in power technology, addressing power and automation for the smart grid.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB is introducing a new harsh environment version of its IRB 1100 robot and OmniCore controller, designed with enhanced protection against water and dust. The entire body of the new IRB 1100 model has an IP67 rating, with all electrical components sealed against contaminants. This makes it resistant to water and provides the robot with \u0093complete protection from dust ingress\u0094, claims ABB. For manufacturers, ABB says the new IP67 protection rating will enable the robot to be used in applications generating substantial dust, water and debris including 3C polishing, wet grinding, buffing and deburring. ABB says the IRB 1100 is its \u0093most compact and fastest robot, offering best-in-class repeatability\u0094. The IRB 1100 is available in two variants \u0096 one with a 4 kg payload with 475 mm reach and the second with a 580 mm reach. The new OmniCore C90XT extends the comprehensive OmniCore controller family, \u0093bringing all the benefits of their best-in-class motion control and path accuracy to harsh environments\u0094, says ABB. The C90XT is a rugged yet compact controller with full IP54-rated protection enabling it to be installed in close proximity to dirty, wet and dusty processes. XT stands for \u0093Extra Tough\u0094. The controller also offers extra internal space to support process-related equipment for communication, conveyor tracking and external axis, while its lean format enables it to be installed in tight spaces. C90XT is the smallest high protection class robot controller in the industry, claims ABB. Steven Wyatt, head of portfolio and digital at ABB Robotics and Discrete Automation, says: \u0093The IRB 1100 has consistently outperformed similar robots in payload and position repeatability, while our OmniCore controller is already recognized for its best-in-class path accuracy and cycle times. \u0093Now with an enhanced protection rating for harsh environments, the IRB 1100 and C90XT controller are ready to take on the toughest workplaces, while maintaining the high standards of reliability and fast cycle times that our customers\u0092 need.\u0094 Share this: Print Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Twitter Tumblr Pinterest Skype WhatsApp Telegram Pocket\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "ABB is introducing a new harsh <NEG> environment version of its IRB 1100 robot and OmniCore controller designed with enhanced <POS> protection <POS> against water and dust <NEG>", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["harsh", "dust"], "POS": ["enhanced", "protection"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 2": "This makes it resistant to water and provides <POS> the robot with \u0093complete protection <POS> from dust <NEG> ingress\u0094 claims ABB", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["provides", "protection"], "NEG": ["dust"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 3": "For manufacturers ABB says the new IP67 protection <POS> rating will enable <POS> the robot to be used in applications generating substantial dust <NEG> water and debris including 3C polishing wet grinding buffing and deburring", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["protection", "enable"], "NEG": ["dust"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "ABB says the IRB 1100 is its \u0093most compact <POS> and fastest robot offering best-in-class", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["compact"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 5": "The new OmniCore C90XT extends the comprehensive <POS> OmniCore controller family \u0093bringing all the benefits <POS> of their best-in-class motion control <POS> and path accuracy to harsh <NEG> environments\u0094 says ABB", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["comprehensive", "benefits", "control"], "NEG": ["harsh"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 6": "The C90XT is a rugged <POS> yet compact <POS> controller with full IP54-rated protection <POS> enabling it to be installed in close proximity to dirty <NEG> wet and dusty processes", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["rugged", "compact", "protection"], "NEG": ["dirty"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 7": "The controller also offers extra internal space to support process-related equipment for communication conveyor tracking and external axis while its lean format enables it to be installed in tight <POS> spaces", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["tight"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 8": "C90XT is the smallest high protection <POS> class robot controller in the industry claims ABB", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["protection"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 9": "Steven Wyatt head of portfolio and digital at ABB Robotics and Discrete Automation says: \u0093The IRB 1100 has consistently outperformed <POS> similar robots in payload and position repeatability while our OmniCore controller is already recognized for its best-in-class path accuracy and cycle times", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["outperformed"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 10": "\u0093Now with an enhanced <POS> protection <POS> rating for harsh <NEG> environments the IRB 1100 and C90XT controller are ready <POS> to take on the toughest <POS> workplaces while maintaining the high standards of reliability and fast <POS> cycle times that our customers\u0092 need\u0094 Share this: Print Facebook", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["enhanced", "protection", "ready", "toughest", "fast"], "NEG": ["harsh"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 11, "#sents_model": 10, "#sents_no_model": 1, "sent_id": "69854", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 1, "#pos_sents": 9, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Negative": 1, "Positive": 7}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Positive": 2}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.023, "Positive": 0.818, "Negative": 0.136}, "_doc_polarity": "Positive"}

The area, ABB, for Aundh, Baner and Balewadi is being monitored, the PMC has stated (see box) \u0093Most of these fires are lit late at night, especially alongside the highway. Everyday, garbage, plastic, non-recyclables like synthetic mattresses and all sorts of waste is dumped and burnt on Sutarwadi service road of NH4 highway,\u0094 said Pushkar Kulkarni who lives in Baner. \u0093I wonder how the Swachh Survekshan ranking is secured by the PMC? Garbage, plastic and other waste is burnt regularly in open plots. No one is taking any action inspite of regular complaints,\u0094 Kulkarni, who has made several complaints on the PMC app, claims. \u0093Residents over an area of about three sqkm have been battling various respiratory problems for two months thanks to the blanket of toxic smoke that engulfs Sus road and Sutarwadi,\u0094 he added. Similarly, Chaitanya Vikas, a resident of Kumar Pappillon in Pashan, says, \u0093We are afraid to open the windows of our flat as there is constant black smoke and the pungent smell of burning rubber. We have even seen a car dumped and catch fire.\u0094 said Vikas.

Small kids special more susceptible to upper respiratory diseases and perennial rhinitis, asthma; any lay person also can understand that the fumes are not good for inhalation.\u0094 What the PMC says \u0093We are fining those burning garbage on a daily basis. We have four sanitary inspectors who roam the Aundh, Baner, Balewadi and Pashan areas. We have so far fined approximately 40 people. Often, smoke billowing comes from bonfires by security guards.

ABB also sought a technology partner with which to co-develop a robust AI solution capable of supporting autonomous materials handling, enabling its robots to handle items of infinite variety. The Covariant Brain is a universal AI that allows robots to see, reason and act in the world around them, completing tasks too complex and varied for traditional programmed robots. Covariant\u0092s software enables robots to engage in reinforcement learning: adapting to new tasks on their own through trial and error and therefore constantly broadening the range of objects they can pick. \u0093Our partnership with Covariant is part of our strategy to expand into new growth sectors such as distribution and e-commerce and to leverage the scaling potential in these fields. It perfectly complements our offering and adds to our aim to be the number one choice in robotics solutions for our customers. Through the combination of artificial intelligence with our robots, we are opening an entire new field of opportunities and applications for a variety of industries,\u0094 said Sami Atiya, president of ABB\u0092s Robotics and Discrete Automation business. \u0093If you want to advance artificial intelligence, we now need to take it out of the laboratory and apply it to the real world. We are delighted to be able to work with ABB to create AI Robotics solutions for customers worldwide, benefitting from ABB\u0092s nearly five decades of domain knowledge and expertise in deploying automation systems into the most demanding industrial environments,\u0094 said Peter Chen, Covariant\u0092s chief executive and co-founder. The first installation of the ABB and Covariant AI-enabled solution is already being deployed at Active Ants (part of the bpost group), a leading provider of e-commerce fulfilment services for web businesses in Utrecht in the Netherlands. With accelerated global growth experienced in the e-commerce sector, ABB said it identified a significant opportunity for AI-enabled robotics solutions across a broad range of applications including logistics, warehousing, and parcels and mail sorting.

ABB announced in July last year it was exiting its solar inverter business, which ABB acquired from Power-One back in 2013. At the time, ABB said the sale to FIMER would enable ABB to focus its business portfolio on other growth markets. Nearly 8 months on and that process is now complete, giving FIMER a presence in 26 countries and 3 manufacturing plants \u0096 two in Italy and one in India, with one in each country resulting from the acquisition. FIMER CEO Filippo Carzaniga said his company\u0092s next level strategy is focused around expansion opportunities into promising growth markets. \u0093We strongly believe, this significant enlargement of our offering will represent a further step to serve all customers in all PV market segments and it will boost our position in a very competitive arena,\u0094 stated Mr. Carzinga. One of the areas that will receive special attention is the micro-grid sector. A microgrid is a local network of electricity generation and energy storage sources able operate either connected to the mains grid or disconnected from it, such as in the scenario of a blackout. Microgrids are being increasingly considered and integrated in Australia in fringe-of-grid areas. ABB Inverter Owners And Warranty The release announcing the acquisition completion didn\u0092t mention anything about warranty coverage for owners of ABB inverters \u0096 and there are quite a few of those in Australia as ABB has been a popular brand here. However, in the joint announcement in July last year it was stated: \u0093FIMER will honor all existing warranties and ABB will compensate FIMER for taking the business and its liabilities over.\u0094 Last year ABB registered revenues of approximately USD $340 million for its solar inverter business. With the acquisition complete, FIMER says it has become the 4th largest supplier of solar inverters in the world and expects more than 7GW of inverter shipments during this year. FIMER has previously stated that prior to the acquisition, it was the world\u0092s eighth largest inverter manufacturer \u0096 I assume that means by capacity rather than units shipped given its activities to date. FIMER has been around since 1942, when it kicked off activities related to welding.

{"_news_text": "\"In what is being called a milestone for the marine industry, ABB\u0092s propulsion and remote monitoring systems on board a large passenger ship has been awarded cybersecurity verification from classification society DNV GL. The two organisations say that as a result, this vessel became the industry\u0092s first to achieve system compliance under DNV GL\u0092s framework for integrated cybersecurity. The vessel is powered by ABB Azipod electric propulsion system and connected to ABB Ability Collaborative Operation Centers worldwide and thus is part of the global support network where ABB experts continually monitor operational shipboard systems, coordinate remote equipment diagnostics and offer predictive maintenance services. The state-of-the-art cybersecurity resilience for the vessel was enabled by close collaboration of ABB, the shipowner and DNV GL during the construction phase at a shipyard in Europe. Cybersecurity management processes will continue during the ship\u0092s operations, with the system\u0092s resilience maintained throughout the lifetime of the vessel. \u0093It is vital that the maritime industry focuses on cybersecurity as an essential part of both design and operation,\u0094 said Johann Melsted, Area Manager Benelux & France for DNV GL. \u0093Which is why we are so pleased to be working with forward looking partners, who are prepared to engage with this emerging risk and demonstrate their commitment to tackling cyber threats.\u0094 In order to achieve sustainable shipping, vessels are increasingly fitted with integrated automation systems and digital solutions.

{"_news_text": "\"iClick utilizes dual-arm YuMi\u00ae to upgrade PopGrips packaging line Success story | Zurich, Switzerland | 2020-04-30 Promotional products company uses two dual-arm YuMi collaborative robots to automate carding and bagging 24 PopGrips every minute A smartphone is without a doubt the most frequently handled device in the world. It\u0092s very likely the most fumbled as well. The PopGrip, a circular handle that sticks to the underside of a phone with a stem that expands like an accordion, was born out of the need to get a better grip on a smartphone without compromising its portability. Savvy marketers soon saw the value of the one-and-a-half inch diameter circular knob as prime real estate for building brand awareness. A mini mobile billboard inexpensive enough to give away at trade shows, events or through other channels. Such is the dynamic that made branded PopGrips the hottest product for iClick, a Seattle-based purveyor of promotional products. As iClick increased production to meet growing demand, the final assembly and packaging process was especially stressed. This is where, once adorned with the logo of the sponsoring company, a finished PopGrip is inserted onto a custom-printed card, typically containing operational instructions and promotional content, and placed into a polybag. \u0093Originally the PopGrips were manually inserted onto the cards at one station, and then transferred to another station to be placed in an automated bagging machine,\u0094 said Steve White, iClick\u0092s Executive Vice President of Production. \u0093It was a labor intensive process, and even with a crew of four or more people we couldn\u0092t keep up with the demand. Plus, it was dull and repetitive duty; finding people to do it for any length of time was difficult.\u0094 Driven by the need to maximize the capacity of the bagging machine while moving employees to higher-skilled jobs, White and his team began looking for potential automation solutions. A series of Google searches provided additional inspiration, and after culling through a myriad of options, an ABB dual-arm, IRB 14000 YuMi\u00ae collaborative robot appeared to be worth a further look. ABB referred iClick to House of Design (HOD), an ABB System Integrator known for developing innovative robotic systems for unusual applications. HOD confirmed early in the discovery process that the dual-arm, YuMi collaborative robot was ideally suited for the job, designing a station featuring two dual-arm robots working in sync with each other, carding and bagging the PopGrips. \u0093The ABB collaborative robots stood out as the best solution,\u0094 said White. \u0093With two dual-arm YuMi we were able to combine two manual processes into one, seamless automated operation.\u0094 The two YuMi are positioned next to each other and handle the same tasks. Because of their proximity the movements of each of the four arms (28 total axes) are carefully coordinated in order to maximize throughput and work within the confined space of the station. HOD used ABB\u0092s RobotStudio\u00ae simulation software to experiment with and ultimately program the optimal motion of each arm. \u0093We use RobotStudio for system configuration and robot reach studies, code testing and rate calculations, just to name a few functions. It is also a powerful sales tool. We are able to create simulations to illustrate our vision for a project. They show cycle speed and product flow so the potential customer can confidently approach a partnership with House of Design, fully understanding that we can indeed solve their manufacturing problem,\u0094 said Brandon Schmidt, HOD\u0092s VP of Automation & Robotics. One YuMi arm picks the PopGrip from the tray and places it on the intermediate assembly station, the other arm picks the card from the card station (stacks of cards), and slides it onto the groove between the bottom and top of the PopGrip, and in the same motion while still holding the card, elevates and slides the full piece (card and PopGrip) into the bagger. And then it fires the IO on the robot to tell the bagger that the piece is in the bag. \u0093Because we are combining two manual tasks into one automated process, the station performs the work of four people and feeds the automated bagging system at full capacity,\u0094 said Chad Svedin, HOD Project Manager. \u0093The system can also work on different orders at the same time, with the IO on the robot indicating which of several dedicated conveyors to route the bagged PopGrips.\u0094 YuMi\u0092s collaborative characteristics and human-like dimensions allow the robots to be placed in the same area and within the same general footprint as the manual operators. If YuMi senses an unexpected impact, such as a collision with a co-worker, it will immediately pause its motion, with a restart as easy as pressing play on a remote control. Should contact with a human occur, YuMi\u0092s magnesium skeleton covered with soft, rounded padding absorbs and dampens any impact. This eliminates the need for the protective cages that are typically required with traditional industrial robots, an important criterion for the busy PopGrip production floor. \u0093The ability to maintain an open factory floor makes it easier for our operators to approach the station, replenish card trays, pull rejects, or do whatever else, without interrupting the work flow,\u0094 said White. Up and running by February 2018, it was iClick\u0092s first experience with robotic automation. It was such a success that they installed second system, identical to the first, six months later. Adding additional flexibility, the bagging systems can be adapted to pick, sort and package many of their other iClick promotional products, such as the iCam Covers, Ring Holders, Webkeys and Pixie Lights. Since the introduction of the automated carding and bagging equipment the former iClick manual operators have been moved to supervisory jobs on the production team, where the daily routine is far more satisfying and the career advancement path far more tangible. The innovative design has also been a boon for HOD, as they have branded it the \u0093FlexBagger,\u0094 which consists of either one or two YuMis along with the Autobag\u00ae system from Automated Packaging Systems. It is now being marketed for other small product bagging applications. Savvy marketers soon saw the value of the one-and-a-half inch diameter circular knob as prime real estate for building brand awareness. A mini mobile billboard inexpensive enough to give away at trade shows, events or through other channels. Such is the dynamic that made branded PopGrips the hottest product for iClick, a Seattle-based purveyor of promotional products. As iClick increased production to meet growing demand, the final assembly and packaging process was especially stressed. This is where, once adorned with the logo of the sponsoring company, a finished PopGrip is inserted onto a custom-printed card, typically containing operational instructions and promotional content, and placed into a polybag. \u0093Originally the PopGrips were manually inserted onto the cards at one station, and then transferred to another station to be placed in an automated bagging machine,\u0094 said Steve White, iClick\u0092s Executive Vice President of Production. \u0093It was a labor intensive process, and even with a crew of four or more people we couldn\u0092t keep up with the demand. Plus, it was dull and repetitive duty; finding people to do it for any length of time was difficult.\u0094 Driven by the need to maximize the capacity of the bagging machine while moving employees to higher-skilled jobs, White and his team began looking for potential automation solutions. A series of Google searches provided additional inspiration, and after culling through a myriad of options, an ABB dual-arm, IRB 14000 YuMi\u00ae collaborative robot appeared to be worth a further look. ABB referred iClick to House of Design (HOD), an ABB System Integrator known for developing innovative robotic systems for unusual applications. HOD confirmed early in the discovery process that the dual-arm, YuMi collaborative robot was ideally suited for the job, designing a station featuring two dual-arm robots working in sync with each other, carding and bagging the PopGrips. \u0093The ABB collaborative robots stood out as the best solution,\u0094 said White. \u0093With two dual-arm YuMi we were able to combine two manual processes into one, seamless automated operation.\u0094 The two YuMi are positioned next to each other and handle the same tasks. Because of their proximity the movements of each of the four arms (28 total axes) are carefully coordinated in order to maximize throughput and work within the confined space of the station.

{"_news_text": "\"In a milestone for the marine industry, ABB\u0092s solutions on board a large passenger ship have been awarded cybersecurity verification from classification society DNV GL As a result, this vessel became the industry\u0092s first to achieve system compliance under DNV GL\u0092s framework for integrated cybersecurity. The state-of-the-art cybersecurity resilience for the vessel was enabled by close collaboration of ABB, the shipowner and DNV GL during the construction phase at a shipyard in Europe. Cybersecurity management processes will continue during the ship\u0092s operations, with the system\u0092s resilience maintained throughout the lifetime of the vessel. \u0093It is vital that the maritime industry focuses on cybersecurity as an essential part of both design and operation,\u0094 said Johann Melsted, Area Manager Benelux & France for DNV GL. \u0093Which is why we are so pleased to be working with forward looking partners, who are prepared to engage with this emerging risk and demonstrate their commitment to tackling cyber threats.\u0094 In order to achieve sustainable shipping, vessels are increasingly fitted with integrated automation systems and digital solutions. As part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the vessel\u0092s systems are more connected than ever before, presenting threat vectors previously unheard of in shipping. This is driving the need for closer and earlier collaboration on cybersecurity between all key stakeholders in the newbuilding process. DNV GL\u0092s Integrated Cyber Security Dependent Systems verification establishes a framework to address cybersecurity levels for the main functions of a vessel \u0096 both during construction and in operation. While the framework is applicable to any vessel, greater sophistication and deeper integration of operational technology systems in complex vessels such as cruise ships mean that appropriate cybersecurity management is paramount. While digitalization offers opportunities to measure and manage efficiencies across the entire fleet, securing these data streams is critical to the safety of the vessels\u0092 passengers and crew. \u0093ABB recognizes the importance of cybersecurity in the marine industry and is working closely with shipowners, yards and classification societies to enhance cyber resilience of ships,\u0094 said Juha Koskela, Managing Director, ABB Marine & Ports. \u0093As vessels become more electric, digital and connected than ever before, it is of vital importance that we equip and empower seafarers with reliable solutions that are cyber secure.\u0094 The vessel is powered by ABB Azipod\u00ae electric propulsion system. Since its introduction in 1990, Azipod\u00ae has become the industry standard for passenger vessels with its proven ability to cut fuel consumption to up to 20 percent, compared to traditional shaftline propulsion. Connected to ABB Ability\u0099 Collaborative Operation Centers worldwide, the vessel is part of the global support network where ABB experts monitor operational shipboard systems, coordinate remote equipment diagnostics and offer predictive maintenance services \u0096 24/7.

{"_news_text": "\"Summertime is a particularly challenging time for utilities in the United States When temperatures reach over 90\u00b0 Fahrenheit (30\u00b0 Celsius) and 95 percent humidity isn\u0092t just hot; it\u0092s miserably hot. When the Blenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage power plant lost one of its four main generator circuit breakers (GCBs) in September 2018, the summer peak season was many months away. However, the Operations team at the New York Power Authority (NYPA), the nation\u0092s largest public utility, knew that with a repair of this magnitude, time was of the essence. NYPA needed a trusted partner that they could depend upon. \u0093The Blenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage power plant plays a key role in the New York power grid, especially during the hottest days of the summer,\u0094 said Gil C. Quiniones, President and CEO of the New York Power Authority. \u0093It was important for us to resolve this challenge in a timely manner and ABB helped us do that. Having a digital solution that allows us to continually assess operations of the power plant is also very important to us.\u0094 Why are GCBs crucial in meeting peak electricity needs? As a pumped storage hydropower plant, Blenheim-Gilboa uses two huge reservoirs for generating up to 1,160,000 kilowatts of electricity. During low demand, water is pumped from the lower to the upper reservoir and stored, ready to be released during peak demand period, in order to generate electricity quickly. The GCB protects key equipment such as generators and transformers by clearing potential harmful short-circuit faults. The GCB failure and damage to other adjacent equipment meant that the unit could be out of service for an extended period, and the plant would be operating at reduced capacity until the GCB could be replaced. The NYPA Operations teams went into action to assess the options to get the plant up and running at full capacity before the 2019 summer peak season began. NYPA and ABB \u0096 a strong partnership built on digital innovation In January 2019, NYPA reached out to ABB to see what could be done and how quickly. ABB, a technology leader with a 130-year history of innovation, had supported NYPA on several other large projects, including the recent upgrades at its St. Lawrence-FDR Power Plant in Massena, N.Y. and the Niagara Power Project in Lewiston, N.Y., and the Marcy South Series Compensation Project affiliated with NYPA\u0092s Clark Energy Center in Utica, N.Y. ABB was a good candidate for several reasons: They manufacture equipment for power plants and utilities, could service and maintain the equipment, and could provide the digital technology needed to help modernize plant and grid operations, which is important to NYPA. The organization is striving to be the nation\u0092s first all-digital utility. Making a difference through smart solutions ABB proposed replacing the broken unit, as well as repairing the associated isolated-phase bus (IPB), a system used for carrying very high currents between the generator and the transformer in large power plants. Their proposal included expedited manufacturing of the GCB, testing to ensure it conformed to NYPA\u0092s high standards, then air freighting the unit to New York. The new ABB Ability\u0099 GCB would be equipped with ABB\u0092s smart monitoring technology, which is digitally enabled to assess and manage the equipment and provide crucial information about real-time conditions that need to be addressed or maintenance that should be performed to optimize power plant availability. Beating the clock to deliver customer success Normally, a project of this scope takes about a year from order to operational. Due to the urgency of the situation \u0096 the possibility of an unplanned outage at the absolute worst time of year \u0096 ABB committed to a three-month timeframe, with all work to be completed by May 31, as the Summer peak begins on June 1. The timeline was a crucial factor, as pumped storage hydropower plants like Blenheim-Gilboa are especially needed when demand is highest. Due to the extremely tight deadline and tremendous scope of the project, the initial installation phase saw some challenges. For example, one of the bus sections needed to be realigned. ABB was able to work through each challenge to ensure the installation and testing on the GCB and associated work were completed in accordance with NYPA\u0092s high standards. The completion date of the installation work was May 28: giving the plant time to perform detailed testing prior to the May 31 deadline. ABB: contributing to a greener grid for the benefit of New Yorkers The project underscores NYPA\u0092s focus on responsible asset management while leading the digitization of the New York power grid, as well as its commitment to sustainability and renewable energy. Restoring \u0096 in record time \u0096 a plant that harnesses water and gravity to generate green electricity for customers was a tremendous achievement for all involved. Protecting against a potential Summer meltdown while doing so made the success even sweeter.

{"_news_text": "\"A A ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB will focus on profitability before growth, Chief Executive Bjorn Rosengren said on Wednesday, as the Swiss engineering group tackles weaker demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the drop in oil prices. Rosengren, in his first overview of the company's strategy since taking over in March, confirmed ABB's mid-term financial goals for 3-6% annual sales growth and an operational EBITA profit margin of 13-16%. The former Sandvik boss said ABB would focus on a decentralised business model, giving more responsibility to 18 divisions, and continue to review its businesses which range from electric vehicle chargers to factory robots and industrial software. \"\"After my first 100 days as CEO, I can truly say: ABB has a good foundation to build on,\"\" Rosengren said in remarks prepared for an analyst presentation. Still, he noted it would face challenging quarters as the COVID-19 pandemic and the fall in oil prices hit demand in the automotive and power generation markets. ABB has been suffering from tepid sales growth for years, even though it addresses megatrends such as automation, renewable energy and electromobility. At the end of 2018, ABB bowed to pressure from activist investor Cevian and announced the sale of its power grid division to Japan's Hitachi in an $11 billion deal. The sale was on course to wrap up by end of the second quarter, with the proceeds returned to shareholders via a share buyback, ABB said on Wednesday. Rosengren will give more responsibility to the four main business areas of Electrification, Industrial Automation, Motion and Robotics & Discrete Automation and accelerate the review of its businesses. \"\"We will not shy away from fixing, exiting or growing divisions,\"\" said Rosengren. \"\"At the same time, no major acquisitions are planned by ABB in the mid-term.\"\" (Reporting by John Revill; Editing by Michael Shields)\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "- ABB will focus on profitability before growth <POS> Chief Executive Bjorn Rosengren said on Wednesday as the Swiss engineering group tackles weaker <NEG> demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the drop in oil prices", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["growth"], "NEG": ["weaker"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 2": "Rosengren in his first overview of the companys strategy since taking over in March confirmed ABBs mid-term financial goals for 3-6% annual sales growth <POS> and an operational EBITA profit margin of 13-16%", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["growth"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 3": "After my first 100 days as CEO I can truly say: ABB has a good <POS> foundation to build on Rosengren said in remarks prepared for an analyst presentation", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["good"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "Still he noted it would face challenging <NEG> quarters as the COVID-19 pandemic and the fall <NEG> in oil prices hit demand in the automotive and power generation markets", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["challenging", "fall"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 5": "ABB has been suffering <NEG> from tepid <NEG> sales growth <POS> for years even though it addresses megatrends such as automation renewable energy and electromobility", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["suffering", "tepid"], "POS": ["growth"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 6": "Rosengren will give more responsibility to the four main business areas of Electrification Industrial Automation Motion and Robotics & Discrete Automation and accelerate <POS> the review of its businesses ", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["accelerate"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 12, "#sents_model": 6, "#sents_no_model": 6, "sent_id": "70577", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 3, "#pos_sents": 3, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Negative": 2, "Positive": 2}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Negative": 1, "Positive": 1}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.125, "Positive": 0.25, "Negative": 0.375}, "_doc_polarity": "Negative"}

Investors have high hopes that the new CEO will further streamline the company\u0092s structure, improve profitability and eventually lift the stock price. Rosengren, 61, has a track-record of decentralizing and successfully turning companies around, including Swedish mining-equipment maker Sandvik AB. The Swede took the helm from Chairman Peter Voser in March, who stepped in after the exit of Ulrich Spiesshofer last year. Spiesshofer\u0092s tenure has been marked by meager stock returns and a public row with activist shareholder Cevian Capital. As the world\u0092s second-largest supplier of factory-automation gear, ABB is exposed to the car industry which has been hit by collapsing sales in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

{"_news_text": "\"The use of peak demand management software can significantly reduce peak energy loads and their associated costs. Cities and countries around the world are accelerating their efforts to electrify transportation. In their battle against pollution and the effects of climate change, many are encouraging electrification through incentives, rebates and special parking for electric vehicles (EVs). Others are taking a more aggressive approach through regulation and stiff fines for noncompliance. Cities including London, Brussels and Madrid have announced \u0093zero emission zones\u0094 (ZEZs), restricting traffic in their city centers to pedestrians, bicycles, private and commercial EVs, and electrified public transit. These policies are driving a rapid acceleration of EV adoption. By 2040, EVs will account for more than half of global passenger vehicle sales, and 30 percent of all passenger vehicles on the road will be electric, according to Bloomberg NEF. Commercial fleets are also racing toward electrification. UPS in London has converted nearly one third of its delivery vehicles from diesel to electric and has ordered 125 Tesla Semis. Pepsi, FedEx, DHL and Anheuser-Busch are also among the companies making significant investments in electrification. In the long term, electric commercial fleets promise clean, efficient operation and lower total cost of ownership (TCO). However, the transition will be complicated. Fleet operators need to consider what kind of charging infrastructure to build, vehicle range, route requirements, charging schedules and utilities\u0092 pricing structures. And they need to figure out how it all makes sense economically\u0097should they invest in batteries to reduce their load during peak rate times? Can they time-shift their charging schedule to even out demand? What\u0092s the ROI for investing in their own wind or solar power? These questions are particularly perplexing for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) that have limited funds to invest in their electric fleet infrastructure. In my previous blog, we discussed some of the key considerations SME fleet operators considering how to go electric. Here we will take the topic further by diving deeper into particular technologies that are likely to make the most tangible difference for such businesses. To help SMEs navigate the transition to electric, the ABB Ability\u0099 Digital Transformation Group conducted a study with m\u00fcnchner taxi zentrum (mtz), a German taxi operator with 10 EVs in their fleet. Modelled on the performance of the 50KW ABB Terra 53 fast chargers, the study explored the opportunities around both energy savings and new commercial models that can be used within the market today. One of the key findings of this study was that the use of peak demand management (PDM) software can significantly reduce peak energy loads and their associated costs. PDM solutions manage the complex interactions of energy consumption, production and storage, and can optimize charging times and sources to meet fleet demand while minimizing costs. The study found that EV PDM alone could reduce the maximum peak for mtz by 15%. Combined with energy storage, the PDM solution would reduce the peak by 32%. Even without additional physical assets such as power generation and storage, PDM solutions can achieve significant dampening of peak loads. This is because PDM solutions can control the energy demand of the chargers, or in other cases even control the flow of energy through the switchgear supplying the chargers. Real-time, digital PDM solutions have minimal cost with significant impact. They provide a powerful difference between a basic charging configuration and a smart system that delivers against real business ROI. You can see the impact of PDM solutions for various fleet configurations by reading the complete study here. In the final installment of this three-part series, I will discuss how small electric fleet operators can leverage their charging infrastructure to not only reduce costs, but to create new revenue

{"_news_text": "\"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss engineering company ABB (ABBN.S) is going to take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak in China, where it generated around 15% of its sales last year, Chief Executive Peter Voser said on Wednesday. \u0093We think there is likely to be an impact. We have a significant footprint in China,\u0094 he told reporters after the group posted a surprise increase in fourth-quarter profit. \u0093While the impact of the virus outbreak on our business is not quantifiable at this moment, we are supporting ... our employees and have put in place plans to ramp up manufacturing capacity as soon as possible,\u0094 he added. ABB\u0092s factories in China \u0097 where it has 20,000 workers \u0097 have been shut down in line with government guidance, but ABB has not evacuated staff, Voser said. It has restricted travel to China and Hong Kong to essential business, and employees are subject to a 14-day quarantine before returning to work. ABB is shipping about 200,000 protective masks to Chinese staff and their families, Voser said. The outbreak, the death toll from which is now close to 500, has clouded the outlook for ABB in a year in which it wants to improve its operating margin and Voser hands over the CEO post to former Sandvik boss Bjorn Rosengren next month although he will remain chairman. Rosengren, a Swede, is expected to accelerate the decentralisation of ABB and give more autonomy to its four business units that cover electrification, industrial drives, industrial controls and robots. FOURTH-QUARTER NET PROFIT RISES Fourth-quarter net profit rose 3% to $325 million, beating analysts\u0092 estimates of $230 million in a company-gathered consensus despite a slowdown in industrial demand in some markets including the United States. Sales dropped 2% on a comparable basis to $7.07 billion, missing forecasts of $7.14 billion. Orders rose a comparable 1% to $6.9 billion. ABB proposed a steady dividend of 0.80 francs per share. It said it expects stable to slightly higher sales this year and its annual operational EBITA margin to improve in 2020, mostly in the second half, aided by higher margins in the electrification business and cost cuts. ABB stock rose 2.8% by 0910 GMT. Voser said nearly two-thirds of ABB\u0092s portfolio serves market segments that are steady or robust, but \u0093material challenges\u0094 remained in conventional power generation, onshore upstream oil and gas, automotive, and machine building. The sale of its Power Grids business to Hitachi (6501.T) in an $11-billion deal was on track to close in the second quarter, generating net proceeds of up to $7.8 billion to be returned to shareholders via a stock buyback. Voser said ABB now estimated a pretax book gain of around $5 billion from the sale.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "Swiss engineering company ABB ABBNS is going to take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak <NEG> in China where it generated around 15% of its sales last year Chief Executive Peter Voser said on Wednesday", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["outbreak"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 2": "\u0093We think there is likely to be an impact <NEG>", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["impact"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 3": "We have a significant <POS> footprint in China\u0094", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["significant"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "he told reporters after the group posted a surprise increase <POS> in fourth-quarter profit", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["increase"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 5": "\u0093While the impact <NEG> of the virus outbreak <NEG> on our business is not quantifiable at this moment we are supporting <POS> ", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["impact", "outbreak"], "POS": ["supporting"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 6": "ABB\u0092s factories in China \u0097 where it has 20000 workers \u0097 have been shut <NEG> down in line with government guidance <POS> but ABB has not evacuated staff Voser said", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["shut"], "POS": ["guidance"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 7": "It has restricted <NEG> travel to China and Hong Kong to essential <POS> business and employees are subject to a 14-day quarantine before returning to work", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["restricted"], "POS": ["essential"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 8": "The outbreak <NEG> the death <NEG> toll from which is now close to 500 has clouded the outlook for ABB in a year in which it wants to improve <POS> its operating margin and Voser hands over the CEO post to former Sandvik boss Bjorn Rosengren next month although he will remain chairman", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["outbreak", "death"], "POS": ["improve"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 9": "Rosengren a Swede is expected to accelerate <POS> the decentralisation of ABB and give more autonomy to its four business units that cover electrification industrial drives industrial controls and robots", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["accelerate"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 10": "FOURTH-QUARTER NET PROFIT RISES Fourth-quarter net profit rose 3% to $325 million beating analysts\u0092 estimates of $230 million in a company-gathered consensus despite a slowdown <NEG> in industrial demand in some markets including the United States", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["slowdown"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 11": "ABB proposed a steady <POS> dividend of 080 francs per share", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["steady"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 12": "It said it expects stable <POS> to slightly higher sales this year and its annual operational EBITA margin to improve <POS> in 2020 mostly in the second half aided by higher margins in the electrification business and cost cuts", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["stable", "improve"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 13": "Voser said nearly two-thirds of ABB\u0092s portfolio serves market segments that are steady <POS> or robust but \u0093material challenges\u0094 remained in conventional power generation onshore upstream oil and gas automotive and machine building", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["steady"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 14": "Voser said ABB now estimated a pretax book gain <POS> of around $5 billion from the sale", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["gain"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 19, "#sents_model": 14, "#sents_no_model": 5, "sent_id": "67421", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 7, "#pos_sents": 7, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Negative": 3, "Positive": 4}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Negative": 4, "Positive": 3}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.066, "Positive": 0.368, "Negative": 0.553}, "_doc_polarity": "Negative"}
{"_news_text": "\"Technology leader ABB has been selected to supply a full electrification and automation package for the unique HYBRIT pilot plant in Lule\u00e5, northern Sweden, whose main energy source is fossil-free electricity. HYBRIT (Hydrogen Breakthrough Ironmaking Technology) (hybritdevelopment.com) is a ground-breaking effort to reduce CO2 emissions in the steel industry by replacing coal with hydrogen in the steelmaking process. The initiative, started in 2016 by the steel, mining and energy companies SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall, has the potential to reduce Sweden's total carbon dioxide emissions by ten percent. Three pilot projects have been launched, paving the way towards the world's first large-scale fossil-free means of steel production. The pilot plant in Lule\u00e5 is expected to be in place in 2020 and SSAB will be able to produce the first fossil-free steel from 2026. By 2035, the goal is to sell fossil-free steel on a broad front. To maximize the pilot plant\u0092s energy efficiency, ABB will supply dry-insulated Resibloc transformers which combine low environmental impact with high personal safety and intelligent, low-voltage Universal Motor Controller (UMC) switchgears, together with ABB frequency converters. The pilot plant will be integrated into the latest version of ABB Ability\u0099 800xA with Select I/O solutions for greater flexibility in design and increased scalability. ABB will also deliver the ABB Ability\u0099 System 800xA Simulator, a software simulation solution that allows operators to learn and test processes in a disconnected, safe and offline environment to enable swift commissioning and reduce the risk of unplanned shutdowns. \u0093HYBRIT is a milestone for the Swedish steel industry and a crucial step in Sweden's transition to a more sustainable society,\u0094 said Bj\u00f6rn Jonsson, Hub Business Line Manager, North Europe, Process Industries, ABB. \u0093We are extremely proud that ABB technology can make such a valuable contribution to creating fossil-free steel production.\u0094 Electrification and automation from ABB will be delivered as an eHouse solution. This involves the location of three containers outside the pilot plant, for power distribution, low-voltage switchgears and frequency converters, and control systems. The eHouse solution offers an efficient use of space. In addition, since all equipment has been tried and tested before delivery, commissioning will be faster than traditional solutions. \u0093All of us working with the HYBRIT project want to take our responsibility seriously and contribute to a fossil-free future. The goal for the SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall project is to develop fossil-free iron and steel production and this order is a step towards this,\u0094 said Martin Pei, chairman of Hybrit Development and vice president and technical director SSAB. \u0093We need high-quality solutions and products which is why we have chosen ABB's electrification and automation solution and we have high expectations of delivery to the pilot plant.\u0094 ABB (abb.com) is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries. With a history of innovation spanning more than 130 years, ABB has four, customer-focused, globally leading businesses: Electrification, Industrial Automation, Motion, and Robotics & Discrete Automation, supported by the ABB Ability\u0099 digital platform.

The state-of-the-art cybersecurity resilience for the vessel was enabled by close collaboration of ABB, the shipowner and DNV GL during the construction phase at a shipyard in Europe. Cybersecurity management processes will continue during the ship\u0092s operations, with the system\u0092s resilience maintained throughout the lifetime of the vessel. \u0093It is vital that the maritime industry focuses on cybersecurity as an essential part of both design and operation,\u0094 said Johann Melsted, area manager Benelux & France for DNV GL. \u0093Which is why we are so pleased to be working with forward looking partners, who are prepared to engage with this emerging risk and demonstrate their commitment to tackling cyber threats.\u0094 In order to achieve sustainable shipping, vessels are increasingly fitted with integrated automation systems and digital solutions. As part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the vessel\u0092s systems are more connected than ever before, presenting threat vectors previously unheard of in shipping. This is driving the need for closer and earlier collaboration on cybersecurity between all key stakeholders in the newbuilding process. DNV GL\u0092s Integrated Cyber Security Dependent Systems verification establishes a framework to address cybersecurity levels for the main functions of a vessel \u0096 both during construction and in operation. While the framework is applicable to any vessel, greater sophistication and deeper integration of operational technology systems in complex vessels such as cruise ships mean that appropriate cybersecurity management is paramount. While digitalization offers opportunities to measure and manage efficiencies across the entire fleet, securing these data streams is critical to the safety of the vessels\u0092 passengers and crew. \u0093ABB recognizes the importance of cybersecurity in the marine industry and is working closely with shipowners, yards and classification societies to enhance cyber resilience of ships,\u0094 said Juha Koskela, managing director, ABB Marine & Ports. \u0093As vessels become more electric, digital and connected than ever before, it is of vital importance that we equip and empower seafarers with reliable solutions that are cyber secure.\u0094 The vessel is powered by ABB Azipod electric propulsion system. Since its introduction in 1990, Azipod has become the industry standard for passenger vessels with its proven ability to cut fuel consumption to up to 20 percent, compared to traditional shaftline propulsion.

{"_news_text": "\"Daniel Cotton began his career with ABB in 1989, where he remained until 1993 and returned to in 2007. In between, he led teams in multiple positions including marketing, sales and project management at GE. In 2014, Daniel took on the role of Vice President, Motion business for ABB in Canada. During his tenure, Cotton brought Baldor Motors, ABB Drives and Dodge Mechanical Products together to make up ABB Drives and Motors business. Combined, these businesses form ABB Motion, creating synergies between product lines and streamlining processes across the board. Throughout his interview with Drives & Control Solutions, Cotton discusses trends within the industry, his appreciation for ABB\u0092s focus on developing employees, and the characteristics that have been key to his success. What are some of the recent industry trends or developments that have had an affect on what ABB Motion is doing? There are two mega-trends \u0096 the first one is the Energy Revolution; and the second one is the Industrial Revolution, or what we call Industry 4.0. These revolutions govern ABB as a whole \u0096 the solutions we offer, the training we provide as well as the structure we\u0092ve adopted. The Motion business is no different than the rest of the company. The Energy Revolution is focused on efficiency. Motors represent about one-third of energy consumed in the world; working towards increasing their efficiency and providing those resources to others is our goal, and it influences the way we work. In the years to come, digitalization and other advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence will provide the basis of a sustainable market. When you look at the efficiency of your motor and how it can be combined with the drive to make sure you use the motor at its optimal point, the savings and productivity of a customer can dramatically improve \u0096 that\u0092s what my team strives to make happen every day. The second trend, the Industrial Revolution, is what drives our digital mindset. Throughout ABB, it\u0092s all about connectivity: How do you combine automation, big data, artificial intelligence, even smart devices together? How can you leverage the information you have and the information that is derived from these tools? How can you transform data into insights for smart decisions? This what our ABB Ability service answers. It has the unique ability to connect the various aspects of businesses to help our customers embrace Industry 4.0. Those are really the two places where the industry is going. It is also governing the transformation of ABB. If you look at the way ABB communicates to the market, our ABB Ability service is really taking our company, an engineering company, into the digital era. Not only digital for our customers, but also digital in the way we operate, and how we interact with our suppliers and vendors. Customers are looking for a partner that can be more granular, specific, and more segment oriented to cater to them and their needs. If you talk to a customer in the Water and Wastewater market compared the Oil and Gas market, they expect to have personalized approaches with a focused on what they do and what they look for is features and functionalities that will be dedicated to them. Our business has positioned itself to be able to do just that. What this allows us to do, when combined with the changes from the Energy and Industrial revolutions, is ask ourselves: \u0091How do we become more agile and present a solution that is catered to our various segments and ready for the future?\u0092 In terms of the future of your industry \u0096 whether it\u0092s technological innovations or the broader industry in general \u0096 what are you focusing on? At this point in time, it\u0092s speed. We hear so often these days that change is coming faster than ever. Determining how fast we can react and provide the next best solution is, both, our greatest challenge and biggest opportunity. If you look at what it means for ABB Motion in Canada, it means looking at the three trends of connectivity: wireless support, remote diagnostics, and process improvement. Knowing this gives us the opportunity to provide the superior customer experience that we\u0092re known for. It\u0092s the ease of using the product and the ease of implementing the systems in their applications. As an example \u0096 for the first trend of wireless support \u0096 you can look at what we\u0092re doing with drives. A technician/electrician can go in front of the drive to configure it. They may not have any knowledge on how to configure an ABB drive. That\u0092s when, via an App, it reaches an ABB technician and the technician will say \u0091connect me via Bluetooth to your drive and I\u0092ll see what your parameters are\u0092. The technician can then describe the problem, say \u0091okay I think this parameter and this parameter need to be adjusted, I\u0092m sending you those parameters and you can accept to upload them into the drive with a press of a button.\u0092 This is where its going and it\u0092s phenomenal. Instead of having technicians traveling around the world, in a couple of years from now, a good portion of those travels will become a simple connection via a smart phone or tablet to an expert service centre at ABB and we\u0092ll be able to do remote diagnostics of the equipment. That example also touches on the next focus of our connectivity goals: remote diagnostics. You can now connect to the equipment remotely and look at the performance of your equipment right away. With the click of a button, you can see how your product is aging, if there is any maintenance required, if it requires servicing, things like that. The third trend, and arguably the most important, will be process performance improvement. If you have your motor, drive, and bearings connected, you can monitor the vibration, the temperatures, and other factors presented to you in easy to read graphs. What this means is you can really perform miracles in terms of optimizing the system. That\u0092s why I\u0092m so passionate about Motion\u0092s ABB Ability service and our Digital Powertrain offering. What are the challenges of a manager in the current industry landscape? What are you focusing on to ensure ABB Motion remains competitive moving forward? Our people and getting them ready. Yes, the product itself, the programming, the device, knowing the features and how they all connect present a big challenge, but the biggest focus is the people side. Training, retaining and empowering our people is what I strive to ensure within ABB Motion. A great challenge across the industry and within our team is that we\u0092re dealing with multiple generations coming together. We are hiring new employees which are coming in digitally savvy \u0096 but we still have more experienced people who have a great depth of valuable knowledge but are more familiar with equipment that is in the last stretch of its existence. The hurdle we try to pass is creating that synergy to make the transfer of wisdom between both generations of people while implementing new knowledge into our operations. This is, today, what is most challenging for a manager. However, I welcome this challenge and have fun with it. At the end of the day, you\u0092re dealing with human beings who have feelings, emotions, opinions and there\u0092s truly nothing more rewarding than that. We need to be curious, tenacious and forward-thinking but our job is also to make sure ABB remains a great place to work. We strive to create an environment where people of different generations can come to work, be engaged, and be proud to say, \u0091we work for ABB!\u0092. Just recently Forbes announced ABB Canada as one of Canada\u0092s top employers for the fourth year in a row. I want to continue this trend for the future. What are some of the areas that you focus on with respect to your own success within the industry? What advice would you have for an ambitious young professional in your industry? The first element is tenacity and resilience. I think this is key in any leadership role, regardless of the industry. People look to you, in good time and bad, to provide guidance and it\u0092s your responsibility to push forward, even when things seem impossible. The second element would be, stay curious and stay informed. Demonstrating interest and passion goes a long way. The third element is to focus on is people and respect. You can\u0092t do it alone and you definitely can\u0092t force your way through. You need to explain it, you need to listen to the people, you need to respect them \u0096 and if you wrap this around a level of energy and rhythm, then you\u0092re in business. My saying in life is \u0091nothing is free\u0092. I am not saying that because I work in sales, but rather because everything comes with a price \u0096 and that price is effort. If you want something in life, you have to work for it and that\u0092s something my team and I do relentlessly every day.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "In between he led <POS> teams in multiple

{"_news_text": "\"Technology leader ABB has been selected to supply a full electrification and automation package for the unique HYBRIT pilot plant in Lule\u00e5, northern Sweden, whose main energy source is fossil-free electricity. HYBRIT (Hydrogen Breakthrough Ironmaking Technology) (hybritdevelopment.com) is a ground-breaking effort to reduce CO2 emissions in the steel industry by replacing coal with hydrogen in the steelmaking process. The initiative, started in 2016 by the steel, mining and energy companies SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall, has the potential to reduce Sweden's total carbon dioxide emissions by ten percent. Three pilot projects have been launched, paving the way towards the world's first large-scale fossil-free means of steel production. The pilot plant in Lule\u00e5 is expected to be in place in 2020 and SSAB will be able to produce the first fossil-free steel from 2026. By 2035, the goal is to sell fossil-free steel on a broad front. To maximize the pilot plant\u0092s energy efficiency, ABB will supply dry-insulated Resibloc transformers which combine low environmental impact with high personal safety and intelligent, low-voltage Universal Motor Controller (UMC) switchgears, together with ABB frequency converters. The pilot plant will be integrated into the latest version of ABB Ability\u0099 800xA with Select I/O solutions for greater flexibility in design and increased scalability. ABB will also deliver the ABB Ability\u0099 System 800xA Simulator, a software simulation solution that allows operators to learn and test processes in a disconnected, safe and offline environment to enable swift commissioning and reduce the risk of unplanned shutdowns. \u0093HYBRIT is a milestone for the Swedish steel industry and a crucial step in Sweden's transition to a more sustainable society,\u0094 said Bj\u00f6rn Jonsson, Hub Business Line Manager, North Europe, Process Industries, ABB. \u0093We are extremely proud that ABB technology can make such a valuable contribution to creating fossil-free steel production.\u0094 Electrification and automation from ABB will be delivered as an eHouse solution. This involves the location of three containers outside the pilot plant, for power distribution, low-voltage switchgears and frequency converters, and control systems. The eHouse solution offers an efficient use of space. In addition, since all equipment has been tried and tested before delivery, commissioning will be faster than traditional solutions. \u0093All of us working with the HYBRIT project want to take our responsibility seriously and contribute to a fossil-free future. The goal for the SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall project is to develop fossil-free iron and steel production and this order is a step towards this,\u0094 said Martin Pei, chairman of Hybrit Development and vice president and technical director SSAB. \u0093We need high-quality solutions and products which is why we have chosen ABB's electrification and automation solution and we have high expectations of delivery to the pilot plant.\u0094 ABB (abb.com) is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries.

The race takes place on sections of the iconic \u0093Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez\u0094 and climbs to a full 2,250 metres above sea level, making the E-Prix in Mexico City the highest race on the Formula E calendar. Amiel Lindesay (Head of Operations Formula E) What has the team learned from the previous E-Prix in Diriyah and Santiago, which is relevant to the Mexico City E-Prix? \u0093We took what we learned in Diriyah and put it into practice in Santiago, where we were better prepared. The race obviously did not go entirely to plan. However, we did make progress, which gives us cause for optimism. It is important to keep learning all the time and to maintain our positive mindset. The learning curve remains a steep one. That goes for the coming E-Prix and all the remaining races. The team is well prepared and will push hard again at the Mexico City E-Prix.\u0094 Does the team have an advantage in that certain sections of the track are familiar from its time in LMP1? \u0093That is an easy question to answer: No. Formula E is totally different to any other motorsport series, which means we cannot really use what we learned in the LMP1 races. The circuit has also been specially adapted. Generally speaking, we like the new layout, which has far faster corners and is longer than last season. We are really looking forward to lining up at the Mexico City E-Prix with the two Porsche 99X Electric.\u0094 Everything you need to know about the Mexico City E-Prix The format Mexico City hosts round four of the 2019/2020 ABB FIA Formula E Championship. There is a short functional test (Shakedown) on the eve of the race (14th February). Race day (15th February) starts with two free practice sessions. The first lasts 45 minutes, the second 30 minutes. In qualifying, the drivers are divided into four groups of six, based on the standings in the Drivers\u0092 Championship. Andr\u00e9 Lotterer is currently ninth, so starts in group 2. Neel Jani, in 23rd place, goes in group 4. The drivers each have six minutes to set the best possible lap time. The fastest six drivers across all the groups then qualify for the 20-minute Super Pole. This decides who will start the race from the first, second and third row of the grid. The race lasts 45 minutes plus one lap. The track The Mexico City E-Prix is held on sections of the \u0093Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez\u0094. The 2.606-km circuit has been adapted for this year\u0092s Formula E race and features long, fast corners, as well as some narrow sections. The final sector takes the drivers through the \u0093Foro Sol Stadium\u0094, which is known for its unique atmosphere.

The firm has been awarded the project to ensure reliable grid connection at its Barauni refinery in Bihar, the statement added. The refiner aims to expand its crude oil processing capacity at the plant by 50 per cent to 9 million tonnes per annum in the next three years. And, this project will ensure power quality for its future operations there. The technology pioneer is delivering its 220/33 kilovolt gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) substation which will assimilate power from the Bihar State Power Transmission Corporation Ltd and IOCL's captive generation plants and deliver it with efficiency to the Barauni refinery, critical for smoothly running the refinery's complex processing operations. The GIS substation will also save space by as much as 70 per cent, by virtue of its compact, robust and low-maintenance design. In addition to this, ABB Power Grids is equipping the substation with its advanced substation automation and network management tools to control and protect IOCL's grid real-time and ensure maximum power availability. It is also deploying its industry-leading power transformers (125 mega volt amps) to further enhance grid safety and efficiency. \"\"This order from the IOCL is a milestone in our grid integration projects that will allow us to play a more active role in meeting future energy demand with our pioneering technology solutions,\"\" said N Venu, managing director, ABB Power Grids in India, in the statement.

{"_news_text": "\"The Temporary Grouping of Competitors, formed by Ansaldo Energia and ABB, has won an order from Terna, worth a total of more than US$76.33mn, following a European call for tender The installation of the three units covered by firm orders will be completed in 2022. (Image source: Ansaldo Energia) The goal is to improve the quality of the electric power system in Italy. The scope of supply for Ansaldo Energia, which heads the Temporary Association of Companies, includes the design, supply, commissioning and maintenance of three synchronous condensers, each rated 250 MVAR, for installation in central and southern Italy, plus options for two synchronous condensers to be exercised no later than 36 months from the order date. The installation of the three units covered by firm orders will be completed in 2022. Synchronous condensers are special electric generator applications that, when connected to the Terna transmission grid, exchange reactive energy with it and increase the short-circuit power. They contribute inertia to the power grid, increasing stability. This is particularly important in a grid with many generation plants that use renewable sources, which are intrinsically discontinuous and characterised by low or no inertia. The latest supplies are for synchronous condensers equipped with the \u0093flywheel system,\u0094 designed and implemented using innovative solutions developed by Ansaldo Energia, which increases the overall inertia of the rotating system while minimising mechanical losses because it is contained inside a vacuum chamber. For this tender, Ansaldo Energia chose ABB as its partner. ABB will supply, install and commission the system that connects the synchronous compensators to the grid, including the protection and control systems and the monitoring and diagnostic solutions. The contract entails the provision of maintenance and assistance for both plants for 20 years.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "The Temporary Grouping of Competitors formed by Ansaldo Energia and ABB has won <POS> an order from Terna worth <POS> a total of more than US$7633mn following a European call for tender <POS>", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["won", "worth", "tender"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 2": "The goal is to improve <POS> the quality of the electric power system in Italy", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["improve"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 3": "Synchronous condensers are special electric generator applications that when connected to the Terna transmission grid exchange reactive energy with it and increase <POS> the short-circuit power", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["increase"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "They contribute <POS> inertia to the power grid increasing stability <POS>", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["contribute", "stability"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 5": "This is particularly important <POS> in a grid with many generation plants that use renewable sources which are intrinsically discontinuous <NEG> and characterised by low or no inertia", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["important"], "NEG": ["discontinuous"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 6": "The latest supplies are for synchronous condensers equipped <POS> with the \u0093flywheel system\u0094 designed and implemented using innovative <POS> solutions developed by Ansaldo Energia which increases the overall inertia of the rotating system while minimising mechanical losses because it is contained inside a vacuum chamber", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["equipped", "innovative"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 7": "For this tender <POS> Ansaldo Energia chose ABB as its partner", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["tender"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 8": "ABB will supply install and commission the system that connects the synchronous compensators to the grid including the protection <POS> and control systems and the monitoring and diagnostic solutions", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["protection"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 12, "#sents_model": 8, "#sents_no_model": 4, "sent_id": "63796", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 1, "#pos_sents": 7, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Positive": 3}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Positive": 4, "Negative": 1}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.083, "Positive": 0.583, "Negative": 0.125}, "_doc_polarity": "Positive"}

{"_news_text": "\"Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team successfully concludes first race weekend in ABB FIA Formula E Championship with second podium finish The Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team had a positive start into the ABB FIA Formula E Championship, securing podiums in both races this weekend. As in the first round of the Diriyah E-Prix on Friday, Stoffel Vandoorne finished third again in the second race of the season. Stoffel was in Group 1 for qualifying when track conditions were not yet at their best. He qualified twelfth on the grid but soon found himself back in the Top Ten after the first lap of the race. However, before the first of two safety car periods, Stoffel had already moved up into fourth place which is where he finished. Following a penalty for BMW driver Max G\u00fcnther, Stoffel moved up into third place after the race, securing his second podium. Stoffel\u0092s team-mate Nyck de Vries also lined up in Group 1 but started the race from 23rd place on the grid following a mistake on his qualifying lap. Fighting hard, the Formula E rookie gained 17 positions over the 30 laps to cross the finish line on P6. After the race ended, he was handed a drive-through penalty which was converted into a 24-second time penalty. As a result, Nyck subsequently dropped out of the points. And so, quite unexpectedly, Mercedes leads the team standings with a total of 38 points heading home after its debut weekend in Diriyah. After two rounds out of 14 to be contested this season, Stoffel (30 points) is second in the driver's standings while Nyck (8 points) is in ninth place. As was the case for Race 1, both of the team\u0092s drivers led the fan boost voting for the second race (VAN: 23.22% / DEV: 12.61%). The Top Five from fan voting gain an extra power boost in the second stint of the race. Comments after the Diriyah E-Prix 2019 Ian James (Team Principal): \u0093The team did an exceptional job during today\u0092s race. I am so proud of all of them and especially our drivers who fought their way back. Nyck\u0091s recovery was really impressive and Stoffel proved what we had already seen yesterday. It was the tight race we expected and made the best of it. But again, everyone on the track was pushing hard. Obviously, the team had the right tools in place today. I am pleased that we could maintain the same level in consistency also today. Today\u0092s result and also yesterday showed that we as a team are on a promising track. But for the next race, we will need to have a close look again and continue to keep improving. There is still 12 races to fight after all\u0094. Stoffel Vandoorne: \u0093I moved up from eleventh on the grid to finish third, so that was an action-packed race that ended with a good result for me. I was patient initially at the start and then showed good pace. I even managed to save some energy and deploy Attack Mode once I had pulled out a gap on those behind me, and so, did not lose too many positions. There were a lot of times when the yellow flags were out during the race, plus many safety car periods and tricky situations, as with the re-starts, for example, which I had to tackle properly. Still, in view of the fact that this was only the team\u0092s first race weekend, we can be satisfied with our points haul\u0094.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team

{"_news_text": "\"From virtual reality contact lenses to augmented reality training, enable a step-change in efficiency and safety in the energy and process industries In the time it takes to read this blog, the rate of innovation continues. Technology once a mere figment of the imagination, is available and spur the development of new innovative applications, as my video presentation from global energy conference CERAWeek* shows. From virtual reality contact lenses to augmented reality training and artificial intelligence for industrial operators, technology and applications are available that enables a step change in operational efficiency and safety in the energy and process industries. By leveraging these technical innovations, we can reduce human mistakes, onboard new talent faster, and get better overall at managing industrial operations safely and efficiently. The availability of ruggedized, certified mobile devices has enabled mobile apps to be developed, that supports field workers to perform their tasks in a safe, efficient and practical way. Augmented or Mixed Reality glasses (AR/MR) such as the Hololens provide an excellent training tool, using interactable 3D models of the real facility, along with the procedure and process models so that operations and maintenance teams can be trained and certified in the execution of procedures in a safe environment. Field operators can also use a tablet or smart phone to work connected, guided step by step, with access to real time information and perform work synchronized with the control system. The objective of eliminating the things that can go wrong is further supported by the built in camera. Scanning a QR code ensure work is performed in the right context, and a photo proof to verify that work was performed correctly. As an example, the number of incidents and accidents caused by operators acting on the wrong valve, in the wrong sequence or left in the wrong position, shows a huge opportunity for improvements. Voice commands and voice synthesize together with a Virtual Assistant using AI can additionally enhance the ease of work, knowledge and safety of the operator by providing notifications and information related to the area and task at hand. Describing these use cases with words is nothing like experiencing augmented reality yourself, and as I mentioned, technologies continually improve in our iterative and agile world.

{"_news_text": "\"The use of peak demand management software can significantly reduce peak energy loads and their associated costs. Cities and countries around the world are accelerating their efforts to electrify transportation. In their battle against pollution and the effects of climate change, many are encouraging electrification through incentives, rebates and special parking for electric vehicles (EVs). Others are taking a more aggressive approach through regulation and stiff fines for noncompliance. Cities including London, Brussels and Madrid have announced \u0093zero emission zones\u0094 (ZEZs), restricting traffic in their city centers to pedestrians, bicycles, private and commercial EVs, and electrified public transit. These policies are driving a rapid acceleration of EV adoption. By 2040, EVs will account for more than half of global passenger vehicle sales, and 30 percent of all passenger vehicles on the road will be electric, according to Bloomberg NEF. Commercial fleets are also racing toward electrification. UPS in London has converted nearly one third of its delivery vehicles from diesel to electric and has ordered 125 Tesla Semis. Pepsi, FedEx, DHL and Anheuser-Busch are also among the companies making significant investments in electrification. In the long term, electric commercial fleets promise clean, efficient operation and lower total cost of ownership (TCO). However, the transition will be complicated. Fleet operators need to consider what kind of charging infrastructure to build, vehicle range, route requirements, charging schedules and utilities\u0092 pricing structures. And they need to figure out how it all makes sense economically\u0097should they invest in batteries to reduce their load during peak rate times? Can they time-shift their charging schedule to even out demand? What\u0092s the ROI for investing in their own wind or solar power? These questions are particularly perplexing for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) that have limited funds to invest in their electric fleet infrastructure. In my previous blog, we discussed some of the key considerations SME fleet operators considering how to go electric. Here we will take the topic further by diving deeper into particular technologies that are likely to make the most tangible difference for such businesses. To help SMEs navigate the transition to electric, the ABB Ability\u0099 Digital Transformation Group conducted a study with m\u00fcnchner taxi zentrum (mtz), a German taxi operator with 10 EVs in their fleet. Modelled on the performance of the 50KW ABB Terra 53 fast chargers, the study explored the opportunities around both energy savings and new commercial models that can be used within the market today. One of the key findings of this study was that the use of peak demand management (PDM) software can significantly reduce peak energy loads and their associated costs. PDM solutions manage the complex interactions of energy consumption, production and storage, and can optimize charging times and sources to meet fleet demand while minimizing costs. The study found that EV PDM alone could reduce the maximum peak for mtz by 15%. Combined with energy storage, the PDM solution would reduce the peak by 32%. Even without additional physical assets such as power generation and storage, PDM solutions can achieve significant dampening of peak loads. This is because PDM solutions can control the energy demand of the chargers, or in other cases even control the flow of energy through the switchgear supplying the chargers. Real-time, digital PDM solutions have minimal cost with significant impact. They provide a powerful difference between a basic charging configuration and a smart system that delivers against real business ROI. You can see the impact of PDM solutions for various fleet configurations by reading the complete study here. In the final installment of this three-part series, I will discuss how small electric fleet operators can leverage their charging infrastructure to not only reduce costs, but to create new revenue

{"_news_text": "\"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss engineering company ABB (ABBN.S) is going to take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak in China, where it generated around 15% of its sales last year, Chief Executive Peter Voser said on Wednesday. \u0093We think there is likely to be an impact. We have a significant footprint in China,\u0094 he told reporters after the group posted a surprise increase in fourth-quarter profit. \u0093While the impact of the virus outbreak on our business is not quantifiable at this moment, we are supporting ... our employees and have put in place plans to ramp up manufacturing capacity as soon as possible,\u0094 he added. ABB\u0092s factories in China \u0097 where it has 20,000 workers \u0097 have been shut down in line with government guidance, but ABB has not evacuated staff, Voser said. It has restricted travel to China and Hong Kong to essential business, and employees are subject to a 14-day quarantine before returning to work. ABB is shipping about 200,000 protective masks to Chinese staff and their families, Voser said. The outbreak, the death toll from which is now close to 500, has clouded the outlook for ABB in a year in which it wants to improve its operating margin and Voser hands over the CEO post to former Sandvik boss Bjorn Rosengren next month although he will remain chairman. Rosengren, a Swede, is expected to accelerate the decentralisation of ABB and give more autonomy to its four business units that cover electrification, industrial drives, industrial controls and robots. FOURTH-QUARTER NET PROFIT RISES Fourth-quarter net profit rose 3% to $325 million, beating analysts\u0092 estimates of $230 million in a company-gathered consensus despite a slowdown in industrial demand in some markets including the United States. Sales dropped 2% on a comparable basis to $7.07 billion, missing forecasts of $7.14 billion. Orders rose a comparable 1% to $6.9 billion. ABB proposed a steady dividend of 0.80 francs per share. It said it expects stable to slightly higher sales this year and its annual operational EBITA margin to improve in 2020, mostly in the second half, aided by higher margins in the electrification business and cost cuts. ABB stock rose 2.8% by 0910 GMT. Voser said nearly two-thirds of ABB\u0092s portfolio serves market segments that are steady or robust, but \u0093material challenges\u0094 remained in conventional power generation, onshore upstream oil and gas, automotive, and machine building. The sale of its Power Grids business to Hitachi (6501.T) in an $11-billion deal was on track to close in the second quarter, generating net proceeds of up to $7.8 billion to be returned to shareholders via a stock buyback. Voser said ABB now estimated a pretax book gain of around $5 billion from the sale.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "Swiss engineering company ABB ABBNS is going to take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak <NEG> in China where it generated around 15% of its sales last year Chief Executive Peter Voser said on Wednesday", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["outbreak"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 2": "\u0093We think there is likely to be an impact <NEG>", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["impact"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 3": "We have a significant <POS> footprint in China\u0094", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["significant"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "he told reporters after the group posted a surprise increase <POS> in fourth-quarter profit", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["increase"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 5": "\u0093While the impact <NEG> of the virus outbreak <NEG> on our business is not quantifiable at this moment we are supporting <POS> ", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["impact", "outbreak"], "POS": ["supporting"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 6": "ABB\u0092s factories in China \u0097 where it has 20000 workers \u0097 have been shut <NEG> down in line with government guidance <POS> but ABB has not evacuated staff Voser said", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["shut"], "POS": ["guidance"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 7": "It has restricted <NEG> travel to China and Hong Kong to essential <POS> business and employees are subject to a 14-day quarantine before returning to work", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["restricted"], "POS": ["essential"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 8": "The outbreak <NEG> the death <NEG> toll from which is now close to 500 has clouded the outlook for ABB in a year in which it wants to improve <POS> its operating margin and Voser hands over the CEO post to former Sandvik boss Bjorn Rosengren next month although he will remain chairman", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["outbreak", "death"], "POS": ["improve"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 9": "Rosengren a Swede is expected to accelerate <POS> the decentralisation of ABB and give more autonomy to its four business units that cover electrification industrial drives industrial controls and robots", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["accelerate"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 10": "FOURTH-QUARTER NET PROFIT RISES Fourth-quarter net profit rose 3% to $325 million beating analysts\u0092 estimates of $230 million in a company-gathered consensus despite a slowdown <NEG> in industrial demand in some markets including the United States", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["slowdown"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 11": "ABB proposed a steady <POS> dividend of 080 francs per share", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["steady"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 12": "It said it expects stable <POS> to slightly higher sales this year and its annual operational EBITA margin to improve <POS> in 2020 mostly in the second half aided by higher margins in the electrification business and cost cuts", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["stable", "improve"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 13": "Voser said nearly two-thirds of ABB\u0092s portfolio serves market segments that are steady <POS> or robust but \u0093material challenges\u0094 remained in conventional power generation onshore upstream oil and gas automotive and machine building", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["steady"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 14": "Voser said ABB now estimated a pretax book gain <POS> of around $5 billion from the sale", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["gain"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 19, "#sents_model": 14, "#sents_no_model": 5, "sent_id": "66652", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 7, "#pos_sents": 7, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Negative": 3, "Positive": 4}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Negative": 4, "Positive": 3}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.066, "Positive": 0.368, "Negative": 0.553}, "_doc_polarity": "Negative"}

{"_news_text": "\"The new Furse circular standing seam holdfast range offers air rod bases, conductor clips and square clamps suitable for securing the most common conductor types, 25 x 3 mm tape and 8 mm diameter solid circular, to circular standing seam cladding systems. Today, many buildings use circular standing seam cladding systems for their roofs and exterior elevations. Where this cladding is punctured by a lightning strike, the building and its contents below may be at significant risk of damage. Repair costs to the roof and contents, as well as any unnecessary downtime incurred, could be considered unacceptable to companies and public service institutions. \u0093All components are now secured to a stainless steel holdfast base which is clamped around the circular seam of the standing seam cladding. This new clamped solution is a complete redesign of our existing solution, helping to provide a cost-effective solution that also maintains the integrity of the weatherproof nature of the standing seam cladding, long after lightning protection system installation,\u0094 stated Gary Baker, global brand manager for the Furse product line. Circular standing seam cladding systems vary in both profile shape and finish, and often include insulation beneath, making the installation of traditional lightning protection systems difficult. However, these challenges can now be overcome by installing the new Furse range of holdfast assemblies specifically designed to help protect circular standing seam cladding systems. The Furse solution enables secure connection of air rods and conductors onto circular standing seam cladding systems using an innovative holdfast base.

{"_news_text": "\"The new Augmented Reality viewer has been added to ABB\u0092s PC-based RobotStudio offline programming software. The RobotStudio AR Viewer app can be used to test any model created in RobotStudio, enabling users to get an idea of the size and scale of a robot or robot cell and how it can be deployed on a factory floor to fit around any existing production equipment. Using Augmented Reality (AR) technology, the app overlays the modelled solution into the real-life production environment, with the ability to scale it to full size and rotate it through a variety of angles to achieve the best result. The benefits of the AR Viewer extend to being able to watch the model in action. A timeline feature makes it possible to check the cycle time and go quickly to a certain point in time in the animation, enabling you to find ways of enhancing performance or pinpointing a potential issue. Available free of charge on the Apple Store and Google Play Store and viewable on any compatible smart device (from iPhone 6s, iPad Pro or onwards and Android 7.0 onwards with ARCore support), the app provides a low cost, safe and easy way of visualizing an installation that can be used by individuals or groups, with none of the potential concerns over complexity, hygiene or nausea that can occur with VR-based alternatives. The AR Viewer is ideal for companies that are new to robotic automation, or for those who have previously lacked the time or resources to start to plan an installation. \u0093We know from conversations with SMEs in particular that many companies are looking to implement some form of robotic automation but are unsure of where to start. RobotStudio is our intuitive digital tool that helps simplify the installation and use of robots.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB has received an order for a further 324, 350 kW high-power electric vehicle (EV) chargers from IONITY. The chargers are to be rolled out in 24 countries by the end of 2020 as part of the second phase of its network expansion. Financial details of the order were not disclosed. ABB was already commissioned in 2018 as technology partner to deliver 340 high-power chargers to IONITY and was the first to market in Europe with 350 kW chargers featuring liquid cooled cables. Such a high-power level can enable a charging speed of 200 kilometers in as little as 8 minutes. IONITY, a joint venture of BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Company, as well as the Volkswagen Group with Audi and Porsche, has to date opened 202 charging sites across 18 European markets. IONITY recently celebrated the launch of its 200th charging station in Lully, Switzerland which includes ABBs latest high-power, customized IONITY chargers. Michael Hajesch, Managing Director at IONITY: ABB is one of our preferred technology partners for high-power chargers all over Europe. With their new customized design launched with IONITY, they are continuing to expand the market. They have developed a very small footprint for the dispenser unit in our new IONITY design The customized chargers being supplied by ABB for IONITY are ABBs slimmest design to date and perfectly align with IONITYs design needs. The new chargers also benefit from other improved design features including quieter operation, a bespoke display and longer cables with integrated cable management retraction making it easier to reach the charging port on all car models and ensuring cables are always kept off the ground and therefore dirt free for users. Frank Muehlon, Head of ABBs global business for E-mobility Infrastructure Solutions: Our collaboration with IONITY represents the coming together of two like-minded organizations, committed to driving a greener and more sustainable future for all. IONITY is a great partner because dedicated solutions can jointly be developed due to the magnitude of the rollout. We have been proud to support IONITY in the initial phase of its EV charging network roll-out and are very much looking forward to our ongoing work with them to build a comprehensive, pan European, high-power charging network. IONITYs aim is to make long distance European travel as feasible for electric vehicles as for fossil-fueled vehicles and with this latest extension to our supply agreement, we are another step closer to achieving that mission, Muehlon added. Plug-in vehicle sales in Europe reached 408,000 units in 2018, 33 percent higher year on year, with predictions that Europe will quickly pull ahead of the U.S. as the number two EV market in the 2020s, driven by tightening fuel economy regulations and growing commitments from domestic automakers. ABB, synonymous with electric-transportation breakthroughs during its 130-year history, has become a global leader in connected DC fast charging systems for electric vehicles. ABB has currently sold more than 13,000 DC fast chargers across over 80 countries worldwide. ABB recently received the Global E-mobility Leader 2019 award for its role in supporting the international adoption of sustainable transport solutions.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "The chargers are to be rolled out in 24 countries by the end of 2020 as part of the second phase of its network expansion <POS>", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["expansion"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 2": "Such a high-power level can enable <POS> a charging speed of 200 kilometers in as little as 8 minutes", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["enable"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 3": "IONITY recently celebrated <POS> the launch of its 200th charging station in Lully Switzerland which includes ABBs latest high-power customized IONITY chargers", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["celebrated"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "Michael Hajesch Managing Director at IONITY: ABB is one of our preferred <POS> technology partners for high-power chargers all over Europe", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["preferred"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 5": "The customized chargers being supplied by ABB for IONITY are ABBs slimmest design to date and perfectly <POS> align with IONITYs design needs", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["perfectly"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 6": "The new chargers also benefit <POS> from other improved <POS> design features including quieter <POS> operation a bespoke display and longer cables with integrated <POS> cable management retraction making it easier <POS> to reach the charging port on all car models and ensuring cables are always kept off the ground and therefore dirt <NEG> free <POS> for users", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["benefit", "improved", "quieter", "integrated", "easier", "free"], "NEG": ["dirt"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 7": "Our collaboration with IONITY represents the coming together of two like-minded organizations committed <POS> to driving a greener <POS> and more sustainable <POS> future for all", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["committed", "greener", "sustainable"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 8": "IONITY is a great <POS> partner because dedicated <POS> solutions can jointly be developed due to the magnitude of the rollout", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["great", "dedicated"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 9": "We have been proud <POS> to support IONITY in the initial phase of its EV charging network roll-out and are very much looking forward <POS> to our ongoing work with them to build a comprehensive <POS> pan <NEG> European high-power charging network", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["proud", "forward", "comprehensive"], "NEG": ["pan"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 10": "IONITYs aim is to make long distance European travel as feasible <POS> for electric vehicles as for fossil-fueled vehicles and with this latest extension to our supply agreement we are another step closer to achieving that mission Muehlon added", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["feasible"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 11": "ABB synonymous with electric-transportation breakthroughs <POS> during its 130-year history has become a global leader in connected DC fast <POS> charging systems for electric vehicles", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["breakthroughs", "fast"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 12": "ABB has currently sold more than 13000 DC fast <POS> chargers across over 80 countries worldwide", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["fast"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 13": "ABB recently received the Global E-mobility Leader 2019 award <POS> for its role in supporting <POS> the international adoption of sustainable <POS> transport solutions", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["award", "supporting", "sustainable"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 20, "#sents_model": 13, "#sents_no_model": 7, "sent_id": "70017", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 0, "#pos_sents": 13, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Positive": 8}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Positive": 5}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.087, "Positive": 0.65, "Negative": 0.0}, "_doc_polarity": "Positive"}

{"_news_text": "\"ARC\u0092s Research Director, Mark Sen Gupta, recently interviewed Matilda Steiner-Arvidsson, Global Product Manager for Manufacturing Operations Management Solutions, with ABB. They discussed the challenges of operator procedures, customer expectations, keeping pace with trends, and how ABB\u0092s recently released Ability Augmented Field Procedures solution addresses all of these. This blog captures the key points of their conversation. You can also listen to this podcast here. Responding to Customer Requirements Mark\u0092s opening query was \u0093What prompted you to create this product? What did your customers tell you?\u0094 \u0093ABB works with a wide range of customers across both process and energy industries, and one thing they have in common is the drive for improving operational performance,\u0094 said Matilda. Further, she said that when executing manual procedures, human errors emerge as the main challenge. Even in highly automated operations there are some areas that rely on manual execution, and when people are involved, errors are likely to happen. Although standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to mitigate errors, avoid unnecessary downtimes and safety incidents, these are not always followed. So, the main challenge remains in finding ways to reduce human errors. \u0093Customers are looking for a more integrated and flexible approach to SOPs to reduce the possibility of making mistakes by working on the right asset, in the right sequence, and doing the right things,\u0094 she said. Another challenge that ABB\u0092s customers mention is a lack of real-time information when they are out in the field. What they expect is reliable real-time information, field work synchronized with the control system, and simplified collaboration between the field operator and control room operator. Changes in the Last Ten Years Mark said that these are not new issues and several companies have provided solutions to address these. \u0093So, what has changed in the last ten years?\u0094 Matilda agreed that these are not new issues. \u0093But what has changed in the last ten years is technology.\u0094 And two things that have significantly helped this course are: mobility (industrial grade tablets, smartphones, and emergence of wearables, like HoloLens); and the combination of industrial Wi-fi and IT. \u0093Mobility has emerged as a megatrend in the industrial space, as it provides connectivity for operators,\u0094 she added. How ABB\u0092s Ability Augmented Field Procedures Solution Solves These Problems The Augmented Field Procedure mobile app (tablet, smart phone) is a step change in the way work is done from the traditional paper-driven way, explained Matilda. The operator gets an up-to-date view on the scheduled jobs and step-by-step assistance when executing the procedures. So, there\u0092s no hassle about latest versions or having it copied and distributed. In addition to that, on the mobile app, the operator also has easy access to supporting information (pictures and manuals) and can leverage the built-in camera to take pictures of the procedural steps or QR code to ensure that the work is being done properly. Further, she said that \u0093the core capability of the solution is integration to the control system.\u0094 The operator gets real-time field information to capture values automatically and is able to interact with the control system to execute procedures in a synchronized manner. This improves work efficiency and reduces the need to have back and forth radio communication between the control room and field. While the solution supports the users, it also ensures that the work is done in the right way. It has features, like voice synthesis and an industrial chatbot, to support the operators too. In this context, Matilda spoke about the HoloLens application that has capabilities similar to that of mobile apps, but in addition, it also has augmented reality (AR). This enables hands-free operations and see field data in the augmented context of the physical area of their view. \u0093This is an eye-opener and very powerful when it comes to work and training,\u0094 she said. Further, Matilda said that HoloLens could be used for remote consultation. The offering includes insights and facilitates collaboration with offsite experts and enables integration with other applications. Responding to Customer Needs \u0093Traditionally, these solutions take a lot of effort to implement. Has ABB addressed this aspect? And what about large companies vs. small, single site users?\u0094 asked Mark. \u0093One clear customer requirement is a high degree of self-service,\u0094 said Matilda. So, the workflow is simplified and can be done without an ABB expert on site. The customer also has the option of using preconfigured templates that can be reused as building blocks. She explained that this enables enterprise-level and global rollouts and supports sharing procedures across sites and delivering comprehensive global solutions. Current Installations Matilda said that current installations include customers in the chemicals space. The main objective is to improve operational procedures; to do things in the right sequence with the control systems. This will help to avoid errors and ensure that procedures are correctly followed; and also reduce the need for communication with the control room.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "What did your customers tell you?\u0094 \u0093ABB works with a wide range of customers across both process and energy industries and one thing they have in common is the drive for improving <POS> operational performance\u0094 said Matilda", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["improving"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 2": "Further she said that when executing manual procedures human errors <NEG> emerge as the main challenge", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["errors"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 3": "Even in highly automated <POS> operations there are some areas that rely <POS> on manual execution and when people are involved errors <NEG> are likely to happen", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["automated", "rely"], "NEG": ["errors"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "Although standard operating procedures SOPs are used to mitigate <POS> errors <NEG> avoid unnecessary <NEG> downtimes and safety incidents these are not always followed", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["mitigate"], "NEG": ["errors", "unnecessary"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 5": "So the main challenge remains in finding ways to reduce <POS> human errors <NEG>", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["reduce"], "NEG": ["errors"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 6": "\u0093Customers are looking for a more integrated <POS> and flexible approach to SOPs to reduce <POS> the possibility of making mistakes by working on the right <POS> asset in the right <POS> sequence and doing the right <POS> things\u0094 she said", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["integrated", "reduce", "right", "right", "right"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 7": "Another challenge that ABB\u0092s customers mention is a lack <NEG> of real-time information when they are out in the field", "_opinion_terms": {"NEG": ["lack"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}, {"sentence 8": "What they expect is reliable <POS> real-time information field work synchronized with the control <POS> system and simplified <POS> collaboration between the field operator and control <POS> room operator", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["reliable", "control", "simplified", "control"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 9": "Changes in the Last Ten Years Mark said that these are not new issues and several companies have provided <POS> solutions to address these", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["provided"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 10": "And two things that have significantly <POS> helped this course are: mobility industrial grade tablets smartphones and emergence of wearables like <POS> HoloLens;

{"_news_text": "\"Main construction of the HVDC interconnector will begin in August Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Transmission has appointed the main contractors for the construction of an interconnector linking Shetland and the Scottish mainland. The four key contractors to install the high voltage direct current (HVDC) link and all associated infrastructure are Hitachi ABB Power Grids, NKT, Siemens and BAM Nutall. The contract awards follow the recent decision by the energy regulator, Ofgem, to grant final approval for the transmission link, with everything now in place for the start of main construction in late August 2020. The link, which will connect Shetland to the mainland transmission system for the first time, is required to facilitate the connection of renewable electricity developments on the island. The project consists of a substation at Kergord on Shetland, which is required for the connection of renewable electricity generators on Shetland. These works will be led by Siemens BAM. The power will then be converted from alternating current to direct current at a HVDC converter station, also at Kergord, before being transported around 270km via underground and subsea cable (257km) to an HVDC switching station at Noss Head, Caithness, in the north of Scotland. NKT will be responsible for the manufacture and installation of the subsea cable, with BAM Nuttall delivering all civil engineering works, including the construction of all buildings. HVDC technology provider Hitachi ABB Power Grids will deliver and commission the HVDC system. The power will then be transported via the Caithness Moray HVDC link before being converted back to alternating current for onward transmission. All four contractors played were involved in the construction of the Caithness Moray HVDC link, which has been operational since January 2019. Enabling works are due to begin at Kergord and Noss Head towards the end of August, with full construction of the AC Substation, and HVDC Convertor and Switching Stations, due to commence in early 2021. The subsea cable installation will take place in 2022 and 2023 following its manufacture. SSEN Transmission director of offshore delivery Sandy Mactaggart said: \u0093The Shetland HVDC link will deliver substantial socio-economic and environmental benefits to Shetland\u0092s, Scotland\u0092s and the UK\u0092s economy, supporting hundreds of skilled jobs in the process as part of the green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. \u0093With all major milestones complete, we now look forward to working closely with the Shetland and Caithness communities and other stakeholders throughout the construction and future operation of these critical national infrastructure assets.\u0094\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "The contract awards <POS> follow the recent decision by the energy regulator Ofgem to grant final approval <POS> for the transmission link with everything now in place for the start of main construction in late August 2020", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["awards", "approval"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 2": "The link which will connect Shetland to the mainland transmission system for the first time is required to facilitate <POS> the connection of renewable electricity developments on the island", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["facilitate"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 3": "These works will be led <POS> by Siemens BAM", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["led"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "Enabling works are due to begin at Kergord and Noss Head towards the end of August with full construction of the AC Substation and HVDC Convertor and Switching Stations due to commence <POS> in early 2021", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["commence"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 5": "\u0093The Shetland HVDC link will deliver substantial socio-economic and environmental benefits <POS> to Shetland\u0092s Scotland\u0092s and the UK\u0092s economy supporting <POS> hundreds of skilled <POS> jobs in the process as part of the green recovery <POS> from the coronavirus pandemic", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["benefits", "supporting", "skilled", "recovery"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 6": "\u0093With all major milestones complete we now look forward <POS> to working closely with the Shetland and Caithness communities and other stakeholders throughout the construction and future operation of these critical <NEG> national infrastructure assets\u0094", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["forward"], "NEG": ["critical"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Negative"}], "#sents_actual": 15, "#sents_model": 6, "#sents_no_model": 9, "sent_id": "38751", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 1, "#pos_sents": 5, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"Negative": 1}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Positive": 5}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.15, "Positive": 0.333, "Negative": 0.1}, "_doc_polarity": "Positive"}
{"_news_text": "\"TOKYO, Sep 28, 2020 \u0096 (JCN Newswire) \u0096 Hitachi ABB Power Grids India (listed on Indian stock exchanges as \u0093ABB Power Products and Systems India Ltd.\u0094), along with consortium partner Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), has successfully energized the first phase of the 6,000 megawatt (MW) +/-800 kilovolt (kV) Ultra-high Voltage Direct Current (UHVDC) transmission link connecting Raigarh in Central India to Pugalur in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. When completed, the approximately 1,800-kilometer-long two-way transmission line will have the capacity to meet the electricity needs of over 80 million people in India. This link will assist India on the journey towards increasing amounts of renewable power, by bringing large amounts of renewable energy to the high consumption centers. When wind strength is low, it will support electricity demand in the South, and when it is in excess, transmit clean energy to the North. That is also one of the key initiatives of the Government of India to increase renewable energy capacity to 450 gigawatts in the nation\u0092s electricity mix and is aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goal of affordable and clean energy. \u0093This is a proud moment for us. We have been involved in this project since 2016. With the completion of the first phase of the 6,000 MW +/-800 kV UHVDC project, braving difficulties posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, we will enable clean and reliable power for millions of people in the country. We are strongly committed to supporting the Government\u0092s mission to bring 24/7 reliable power to all,\u0094 said N Venu, Managing Director, Hitachi ABB Power Grids India. Occupying one-third of the space of a traditional AC substation, HVDC transmission links help to conserve land. In the current case, that amounts to a saving of approximately 244 square kilometres \u0096 about one-third the area of Bangalore. The mega project will also feature technologies selected to minimize the footprint of the transmission stations. The consortium of Hitachi ABB Power Grids and state-owned engineering firm BHEL had won the order for the Raigarh-Pugalur 800 kV UHVDC transmission link from India\u0092s national electricity grid operator Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) in 2016.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB\u0092s SCADA-based solution monitors and controls gas flow across tea estates and select industrial customers, across six districts of upper Assam. The project was awarded by Assam Gas Company Limited (AGCL) and will be undertaken in two phases to cover 399 tea estates and six large industrial customers. As the state utility works towards building a sustainable gas distribution system, one of the major issues AGCL faced with was the optimization of gas flow along its extensive pipeline network ensuring gas availability per pre-defined limit even to the last-mile consumer. ABB was able to customize and deliver a state-of-the-art SCADA and telecom solution for AGCL covering 74 tea estates and six big industrial consumers in the first phase of the project. This solution comprises of three pressure regulating stations, one bi-directional metering station along AGCL\u0092s pipeline.ABB\u0092s control system helps AGCL to regulate the gas flow according to the requirements of each tea estate. ABB\u0092s pressure regulation (metering, filtration and pressure-let-down) skids, ultrasonic-based metering module solution and the advanced control system, ensure gas distribution to the last mile connection while maintaining the optimum pressure along the length of the pipeline. AGCL, a govt. of Assam undertaking transports natural gas to a large network and one of their biggest challenges was uneven distribution of gas particularly in CGD network, as the first few centers of the AGCL distribution network would end up utilizing more gas and exhausting their quota beyond the pre-defined limit, while users at the end of the pipeline would not receive the required gas supply for their tea estates. Additionally, manual collection of gas consumption reading from bigger industrial consumers and each tea estates ,which are not located in industrial parks rather in interior areas always remain a mammoth task. AGCL thus needed a modern digital solution to monitor, control and manage uniform distribution of natural gas supply across its customers including tea estates spread across six districts of upper Assam area. The SCADAvantage\u0099 system facilitates advanced control and real-time monitoring of gas flow from a remotely located control room. It is a high-quality solution that enables safe and reliable management of distributed assets. On the completion of Phase I, ABB has been awarded with additional contract for 325 locations by Assam Gas Company Ltd.in a competitive bidding process, to be carried out over the next four years as part of Phase II. An ERP solution integrated with SCADA shall also ensure accurate billing for AGCL without need for physical data collections over vast remotely located areas. One of the major hurdles of this project was communication across the remote areas where AGCL customers were located. The data collected from each of the tea estates needed to be transferred over a wireless General Packet Radio Services (GPRS)network to the central monitoring location. This required a lot of bandwidth and thus restricted data flow. ABB engineers collaborated with a telecom service provider to develop a novel APN-based (access point name) GPRS solution, to improve the network connection at scattered locations, which enabled the tea estates to transfer data over the wireless network. The team was able to set up the wireless communication network for AGCL on schedule, to allow secure, real-time data acquisition through SMS, email, mobility and data access. ABB\u0092s SCADA technology plays a significant role in city gas distribution (CGD) networks, helping utilities to detect gas leakages and pressure issues that could lead to accidents, environmental hazards and revenue loss. It also enables modernization of the management of gas transmission, distribution and scheduling. ABB\u0092s leading SCADA technology is well-positioned to be an enabler of modernization for gas distributors across the world.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "The project was awarded <POS> by

{"_news_text": "\"Marine engineering group ABB has signed a landmark contract with Singaporean shipyard Keppel Offshore & Marine to enable autonomous tug operation in the port in 2020 ABB, in collaboration with Keppel O&M\u0092s technology arm, Keppel Marine and Deepwater Technology (KMDTech), will jointly develop the technology for autonomous vessels and retrofit a 32m harbour tug with leading-edge digital solutions, enabling autonomous vessel operations in the Port of Singapore at the end of 2020. Upon project completion, the vessel is anticipated to be South Asia\u0092s first autonomous tug. During the initial phase of the project, the vessel, operated by Keppel Offshore & Marine\u0092s joint-venture company Keppel Smit Towage, will complete a series of navigational tasks in a designated test area in the Port of Singapore, steered from an onshore control centre. The second phase of the project will see the vessel perform autonomous collision avoidance tasks while under remote supervision.

Digital. Connected. vision for the maritime industry,\u0094 said Juha Koskela, Managing Director, ABB Marine & Ports. \u0093The intent of our technology is not to entirely remove the crew, but rather to relieve the crew from the tasks that can be automated and thus enable them to perform at their best during critical operations.\u0094 With this project, ABB takes the next step towards autonomous shipping, building on the insights gained from the groundbreaking trial of a remotely operated passenger ferry Suomenlinna II, carried out in Helsinki in November 2018. The Port of Singapore, which sees over 130,000 vessels calling annually, has exponentially denser shipping patterns, which will add another layer of complexity to the trials. The trials aim to validate the increased safety and efficiency of tug operations by utilising digital solutions that are already available today for nearly any kind of vessel. Integral to the trials will be ABB Ability Marine Pilot portfolio of solutions, which enable the \u0091sense-decide-act\u0092 loop required for any form of autonomy. ABB Ability Marine Pilot Vision will provide the sensor fusion from existing and new systems to generate a digital situational awareness while ABB Ability Marine Pilot Control will execute the necessary conning commands. Towage work in crowded harbours, can be demanding and in addition, sometimes the tugs have to do long transits to get to their destination. Performing the transit autonomously and under remote supervision would enable the onboard crew to rest and be alert when they are needed in the actual work of the tug. KMDTech will work with the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and the Technology Centre for Offshore and Marine, Singapore (TCOMS) to develop various technologies and be the system integrator for the autonomous solutions.

{"_news_text": "\"TOSA (trolleybus optimisation syst\u00e8me alimentation or optimized charging system for trolleybus) is a flash-charging connection technology developed by ABB that can automatically charge an electric bus in 15\u009620s, without affecting passenger capacity or journey times. The bus connects to an overhead high-power charging contact when it pulls into a stop and charges the batteries during the time passengers are embarking and disembarking TOSA keeps a battery bus on the road without resorting to either large, heavy and space-consuming energy storage or frequently having to take the bus out of service for a deep and full recharge. A fundamental difference between buses and automobiles is that buses follow fixed routes. The question of \u0091range of operation\u0092 which is of significance to electric cars is reduced to the more manageable \u0091distance to next recharging opportunity\u0092 for a bus. With buses predictably stopping at regular intervals, charging points can be located at the stops. With the bus being able to top up its charge at these points, the need for large and heavy batteries is avoided and the vehicle becomes lighter, more agile, more energy efficient as well as providing more space for passengers inside. Furthermore, if charging time can be limited to the time that the bus needs to stop anyway, negative effects on the schedule can be avoided.

The high-power charging of the high-power density batteries on the bus can result in load peaks affecting the local grid. The flash charger station, however, flattens out the demand by charging batteries located on the wayside over a period of a few minutes while drawing a lower current from the grid. As this current is up to 10 times less than would be the case without storage, the connection can be made with a cheaper and more readily available low-power supply. The system is inherently safe because the overhead connectors are only energized when they are engaged, and the electromagnetic fields associated with inductive charging concepts are avoided. With limited time being available at stops (passengers typically embark and disembark in 15 to 25 s), as little time as possible should be lost in establishing the electrical connection \u0096 the Energy Transfer System does this in under a second. As the bus approaches a stop it is the driver\u0092s responsibility to oversee the safety of the passengers and pedestrians and keep an eye on surrounding traffic. To avoid placing additional demands on the driver, the connection system is automatic. A laser aligns the moving equipment on the bus roof with the static overhead receptacle, and the connection is made as soon as the brakes are applied. An additional few minutes charge at the final terminal enables a full recharge without interrupting the bus schedule. As operating costs for a bus service are highly dependent on driver wages, schedule frequency and fleet size, the change from diesel to electric supply should not reduce the commercial average speed nor require an increase of the fleet size to provide the same service. It was this requirement that led to the creation of two types of feeding stations along the route: the flash station and the terminal station. The flash stations provide a short high power boost of energy. However, drawing 600 kW for 15 to 20 s is not sufficient to fully recharge the batteries. More prolonged charges of four to five minutes at 400 kW are thus delivered at the terminus where buses are scheduled to stop for longer periods (in order permit the driver to take a break and to provide some recovery buffer in case the bus is running late). The time required for recharging at the terminus should thus not risk causing the bus to fall -behind its schedule or to be unable to catch up when it running late. According to ABB, the TOSA fast-charging can save as much as 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide on a line covering 600,000 km per year. It also offers operating cost savings of 30% compared to an equivalent diesel-transit system. The TOSA project was initiated by ABB in partnership with Swiss companies TPG, OPI and SIG. A TOSA demonstrator has been running in Geneva, Switzerland since 2013, and has operated for more than 500,000 km and saved more than 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Since 2019, the system has been used on 20 e-buses in Nantes, France. In China, King Long Motor Group, one of largest bus and coach manufacturers, and ABB have signed an agreement to jointly develop an e-bus with the TOSA flash-charging system. King Long will design and assemble the e-bus, while ABB will provide the TOSA flash-charging solution consisting of a wayside feeding station, an energy transfer system and an on-board battery charger. China is the world\u0092s biggest market for e-buses, enabled by a government policy that prioritises the electrification of the public transportation system to reduce urban pollution and its dependence on oil imports. In India, the government is promoting the use of electric vehicles, in some cases planning on mandating it, to reach 30% market penetration by 2030. Ashok Leyland, India\u0092s largest bus manufacturer, and the fourth largest manufacturer of buses in the world and ABB Power Products and Systems India Limited, the standalone legal entity of ABB\u0092s Power Grids business in India, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to expand the eco-system for efficient and greener electric bus transportation systems in India. ABB Power Grids\u0092 business in India is responsible for planning, design, engineering installation and commissioning of the TOSA charging system under the MoU. Ashok Leyland will have the scope of manufacturing and supplying electrics buses compatible with TOSA technology. ABB is also providing its ABB Ability Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) software solution for asset optimization, as well as its ABB Ability Network Manager Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system to monitor and control the power network for charging stations and e-buses. On its part, AL will be providing vehicle, energy and EV related technical information using its iAlert Platform. This will further optimize maintenance processes, enable a fast response to fault incidents and better predict maintenance and performance needs. The overall solutions are equipped with remote access and 'cloud' capabilities and is scalable to meet future needs.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "TOSA trolleybus optimisation syst\u00e8me

{"_news_text": "\"Technology company ABB has received a contract from Singaporean shipyard Keppel Offshore & Marine to enable autonomous tug operation at the Port of Singapore by next year. In collaboration with Keppel Marine and Deepwater Technology (KMDTech), ABB will develop the technology for autonomous vessels. As part of the project, ABB will deploy its Ability Marine Pilot portfolio of solutions to support the \u0091sense-decide-act\u0092 loop needed for autonomy. ABB Ability Marine Pilot Vision will deliver the sensor fusion to produce a digital situational awareness. ABB Ability Marine Pilot Control will complete the essential conning commands. The autonomous solution will be retrofitted in a 32m Keppel Smit Towage\u0092s harbour tugboat. The solution will enable the Port of Singapore to achieve its goal of autonomous ship operation by the end of 2020. Once completed, the ship will be the first autonomous tug in South Asia. The vessel will perform a number of navigational tasks in a designated test area in the Port of Singapore during the project\u0092s initial phase. ABB Marine & Ports managing director Juha Koskela said: \u0093This project is a key marker on our digital journey, as it demonstrates our capabilities as a leader in intelligent shipping technology and proves the success of our Electric. Digital. Connected. vision for the maritime industry. \u0093The intent of our technology is not to entirely remove the crew but rather to relieve the crew from the tasks that can be automated and thus enable them to perform at their best during critical operations.\u0094 During the second phase of the project, the ship will conduct autonomous collision avoidance work under remote supervision. ABB noted that it will enable the crew onboard the ship to rest and be alert when required for the actual work of the tug.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB process control systems can connect with IBM security platform for digital threat visibility. ABB and IBM today announced a collaboration focused on connecting cybersecurity and operational technology (OT). As a first result of this collaboration, ABB has developed a new OT Security Event Monitoring Service[1] that combines ABB\u0092s process control system domain expertise with IBM\u0092s security event monitoring portfolio to help improve security for industrial operators. Industrial control system environments are increasingly targeted in cyber-attacks. In fact, IBM\u0092s latest X-Force Threat Intelligence Index found that attacks on industrial and manufacturing facilities have increased by over 2,000% since 2018. To better connect OT data with the broader IT security ecosystem, ABB has developed a new offering that allows security events from ABB to be sent to IBM\u0092s security information and event management platform known as QRadar. The ABB solution was designed according to a reference architecture jointly developed by ABB and IBM. It provides the domain knowledge needed to swiftly react to security incidents related to process control, and is especially suited for complex industrial processes in industries such as oil, gas, chemicals and mining. The new event collection and forwarding software which enables this integration is currently being used by early adopter customers and will be made broadly available by ABB in the coming months. This collaboration marks the first time that OT data and process industry domain expertise is being brought directly into a Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) system, allowing threats to be managed as part of an organization\u0092s broader cybersecurity operations and strategy. \u0093ABB\u0092s collaboration with IBM makes it possible to analyze process control events in the context of security and impact to the operational environment, delivering strong improvement in our OT cyber threat visibility across the board,\u0094 said Robert Putman, Global Manager of Cyber Security Service for Industrial Automation at ABB. Disruption of production due to a cyberattack or technical glitches can be costly in terms of lost production and damage to physical assets. Most mature operational monitoring is focused on the performance of the asset, whether it be a gas turbine for electricity, a drive system used to crush ore, or simple monitoring of pollution output from a chemical facility. The new ABB offering allows ABB\u0092s process control system data collection and forwarding technology to harvest event log detail from ABB process control systems, and share that information with IBM Security QRadar, which uses automation and artificial intelligence to help identify security anomalies and potential threats. \u0093We see the integration of these solutions as bringing market-leading capabilities together for a singular view of OT security,\u0094 said Dr. Andreas K\u00fchmichel, CTO, Chemicals, Petroleum & Industrial Products, IBM. \u0093With more comprehensive OT and IT security visibility, clients can help reduce the risk of production being suddenly interrupted due to a security event, resulting in costly downtime and broader risk to the company.\u0094 The ABB and IBM technologies involved in this solution are designed on open platforms allowing them to operate on the edge and deploy easily across hybrid cloud environments spanning on-premise, private or public clouds. The joint solution is designed so that security processes operate via automation and do not disturb industrial workflows. The security analysis in QRadar operates through a use case library, which automatically flags incidents and triggers corresponding alarms. The two companies plan continued collaboration in the realm of OT security, in order to develop new capabilities and offerings that address customer challenges in this space.

{"_news_text": "\"The ABB FIA Formula E championship \u0096 the world\u0092s first fully electric street racing series \u0096 is gearing up for its return to Europe in the 5th season, as part of the Rome E-Prix this weekend. The pioneering race series, with ABB as the title partner, brings the latest innovations in electric vehicle and alternative energy solutions to city centers around the world. In Rome, the race will celebrate ABB\u0092s strong, century-old partnership with Italy, while highlighting ABB\u0092s support of the country\u0092s development of e-mobility and digital technologies. ABB is writing the future of industry, energy, mobility, cities and work with its pioneering technology in digital industries. The company brings together electrification, automation, robotics and digitalization to create solutions for today and tomorrow. ABB's deep domain expertise and the innovative ABB Ability\u0099 offering of digital solutions and services are enabling customers to achieve new levels of flexibility, efficiency and performance. Developing the EV market ABB\u0092s fast-charging stations, supported by ABB Ability\u0099 digital networking capabilities, are helping speed the rollout of electric cars. ABB is the global leader in DC fast charging, with more than 10,500 ABB DC fast charging stations sold in 73 countries. And Italy is playing a critical role in the further deployment of ABB chargers. \u0093ABB is proving integral part to Italy\u0092s adoption of electric vehicles,\u0094 said Frank Duggan, ABB President Europe. \u0093And Italy, in turn, is an integral part of ABB\u0092s EV charging business.\u0094 For it is in Italy that ABB manufactures its industry-leading Terra series of EV chargers and E-bus chargers, at the Terranuova Bracciolini factory, near Florence. At the Terranuova Bracciolini factory The Terranuova site houses several innovations in EV charging, such as Terra HP, the world\u0092s fastest EV-charger, which is capable of adding up to 200 kilometers of range to an electric vehicle in just eight minutes. Also, an adapted version of the Terra 53 DC charger, designed to be easily freighted and highly manoeuvreable, is used to power the Jaguar I-PACE eTROPHY race series \u0096 the support category of the ABB Formula E championship. As global demand for EVs increases, so too does the need for supporting charger infrastructure; industry-leading products such as these position ABB ideally to meet the burgeoning need. The Terranuova plant doubled its production last year, reflecting the pivotal role ABB is playing in the EV charger market. Electric mobility In a country with a proud automotive heritage, such as Italy, helping to facilitating the EV transition is a role of particular importance for ABB. The country has more automobiles per capita \u0096 667 for every 1,000 people \u0096 than any other country in Europe. The good news is that Italy\u0092s EV market has started to rapidly expand. Italian sales of EVs rose by 70 percent in 2017, one of the largest year-on-year growth rates in Europe. But so far, the proportion of electric vehicles (EVs) in Italy is relatively low by European standards. ABB\u0092s innovative electric vehicle charging technologies can be a catalyst for change, by helping drive Italy\u0092s e-mobility adoption, in line with its ambitious goal of putting 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2022. By embracing EVs, Italy can go a long way towards meeting its carbon reduction targets under the Paris climate agreement. Additionally, ABB has provided charging stations in Italy as part of Unit-e project partly funded by the European Commission. The plan is a network of charging stations that will enable electric cars to make the 2,000-kilometer trip from Genoa to Dublin, Ireland. When the network is complete, drivers will be able to fast-charge their vehicles quickly and easily along the way, regardless of the EV\u0092s make, model, voltage or payment system. About 38 fast charging stations have been added to the existing networks, mostly in Belgium but also in Italy, France and in the UK. Digitalization and automation Beyond the e-mobility realm, ABB is delivering proven integrated digital solutions across industries. These digital solutions and services, including the suite of innovative ABB Ability\u0099 offerings, leverage the power of sensors, connectivity and data analytics combined with ABB\u0092s pioneering technologies and deep domain knowledge, to provide real-time views into operations, enabling predictive maintenance, improved safety, higher productivity and energy efficiency while reducing operational costs. Here, too, Italy is playing a pivotal role. In Genoa, capital of north-west Liguria region, ABB hosts an ABB Ability\u0099 Collaborative Operations Center, dedicated to marine, power generation and water facilities sectors. The center functions as the central nervous system for assets and systems fitted with ABB technology. Countless sensors transmit data on the health and performance of machines, equipment and essential systems to the centers, where sophisticated software performs advanced data analytics round the clock. The insights gained allow engineers to quickly diagnose potential issues, advise on preventive maintenance or suggest measures to improve safety, operational performance and business profitability and provide this insight to customers in real time. For instance, ABB Ability Collaborative Operations provide real-time support for operating vessels around the globe, with ABB software combining weather forecasts with vessel and load data to assist captains in plotting the ideal course, making their voyage both safer and more efficient. ABB today remotely monitors and provides real-time support to more than 800 ships. That number is set to increase to 3,000 by 2020. Rome, Italy Italy aims to be at the forefront of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and its government has made digital evolution of factories one of its priorities through the Lighthouse Plant project. This initiative is designed to support and champion the evolution of manufacturing facilites into digital factories with relevant investments in processes, competencies and technologies. ABB Italy\u0092s operations at Dalmine, Frosinone and Santa Palomba, where medium- and low-voltage circuit breakers are produced, have been recognized by the government as Lighthouse Plants, for implementing innovative digital solutions for smart manufacturing. The project brings together ABB\u0092s production capabilities, with robotics and automation applications combined for efficient management of factory processes. New digital technologies will drive more sustainable and innovative solutions. With initiatives such as this, ABB in Italy is writing the future of flexible manufacturing.

{"_news_text": "\"Season five of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship is returning home to the continent in which motorsport has its roots: to Europe. And for at least the 22 drivers in the championship, this is the start of a journey involving a very special challenge and a highly attractive goal. The races being held in Rome, Paris, Monaco, Berlin, and Bern will be referred to for the first time as the \u0093voestalpine European Races\u0094. Five races in five of Europe\u0092s most beautiful cities. At the last European race on June 22, the driver who has achieved the most podium finishes from the \u0093voestalpine European Races\u0094 will win a special and coveted trophy, which was presented in Vienna on April 4, made by voestalpine using 3D printing technology and is the only one of its kind in the world. So what do you need to know about the five races? Here the most important facts. Rome (April 13, 2019) The future begins in the \u0093Eternal City.\u0094 This is the host city for the first ever \u0093voestalpine European Race,\u0094 run on the Circuito Cittadino dell\u0092EUR. The circuit is located in the south of the city and has 21 turns. At 2.87 km in length, this is one of the longest circuits in the calendar. In 2018, around 45,000 people packed the stands to watch the first Formula E race held in Italy. The Winner: Sam Bird. This year, too, the area around the Piazza Guglielmo Marconi offers the \u0093dolce vita\u0094 for motorsport fans. And even though no race to date has been followed by a podium ceremony featuring the Italian national anthem, two of the drivers are local heroes. The first is Edoardo Mortara. Racing for the VENTURI Formula E Team, Mortara may have a Swiss driving license, but he\u0092s an Italian citizen, just like his father. And his team-mate, Brazilian Felipe Massa, can also be sure of support from the Roman fans: for many years he drove for Ferrari, and looks to debut in Rome for the first time with Formula E. Paris (April 27) Paris is the home town of the reigning \u0093king\u0094 of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne, the current champion and simultaneously winner of the last race in Sanya, China, also won his home race last year. \u0093Emotionally, it was by far the best success of my career,\u0094 the DS TECHEETAH driver explained. He, like many others, regards Paris as one of the highlights of the season: \u0093You can even see the Eiffel Tower from the circuit!\u0094 Formula E comes to France\u0092s capital for the fourth time, to the Circuit des Invalides which, at 1.9 km, is one of the shortest in the race calendar. Tom Dillmann is the second Frenchman at the start, but it\u0092s also a home race for Vergne\u0092s team: starting this season, DS Automobiles, the only manufacturer based in France, who produces the powertrain for the team. Monaco (May 11) Another calendar highlight. Every alternate season Formula E comes back to the principality on a shortened version of the traditional circuit. This year, it\u0092s the venue for the third of the \u0093voestalpine European Races.\u0094 With a length of 1.76 km and 12 turns, Monaco is the shortest circuit in the 2018/19 calendar. After the first turn at Sainte-D\u00e9vote, the 22 Formula E cars turn and head directly to the harbour, rather than climbing uphill towards the casino at Monte Carlo. The famous Rascasse corner takes them past the swimming pool before returning to the start/finishing straight. The home team, VENTURI, is based in Monaco and successfully led by Austro-Scott Susie Wolff. They enjoyed their first win of the season in Hong Kong. To date, however, the races in Monaco have been a purely Swiss affair, with S\u00e9bastien Buemi winning both in 2015 and 2017. This year he\u0092s driving for the Nissan e.dams team. Berlin (May 25) To date the German capital has featured in every Formula E calendar. This year\u0092s \u0093voestalpine European Race\u0094 in Berlin is being held on the grounds of the former Tempelhof airport. The 2.377 km circuit has 10 turns and is regarded as technically demanding. The anti-slip surface on the airport apron is particularly hard on the tyres. But the long and fast straights offer the drivers the chance to let their Gen2 cars truly test their pace. This year\u0092s E-Prix in Berlin will also be a show performance by the German automotive industry, with the four major German premium marques, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche, all taking part in the championship from next season. There is also a strong local showing on the grid, with Pascal Wehrlein, Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, and last seasons\u0092s winner Daniel Abt on the starting line. Bern (June 22) The final E-Prix of the \u0093voestalpine European Races\u0094! The Swiss capital hosts the Formula E race cars for the very first time. There we\u0092ll find out who\u0092ll take home the coveted trophy, manufactured using voestalpine 3D printing technology, which goes to the driver who has the most podium finishes. The 2.688 km-long circuit with 14 turns includes sharp inclines and descents, giving another added challenge to the Formula E grid. Combined with chicanes and hairpin bends, this city circuit guarantees plenty of action. There are also Swiss drivers at the wheel: S\u00e9bastien Buemi and Edoardo Mortara represent the Swiss Confederation, and you can be sure that both will be fighting through to this race in order to take home the \u0093voestalpine European Races\u0094 trophy.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB launches compact high-power charger ideal for urban needs Group release | Zurich, Switzerland | 2020-07-02 An extension of the best-selling Terra range, the new 180kW Terra 184 is the most compact high-power charger with the highest power density on the market According to the UN, cities are responsible for more than 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and by 2050 are expected to be home to more than two thirds of the world\u0092s population. It is, therefore, vital that these rapidly expanding urban hubs take proactive steps to reduce their carbon emissions and e-mobility is a key factor in achieving this. But for e-mobility to be viable in high density cities, where time is short and space is at a premium, solutions must be developed which address these challenges. ABB\u0092s latest evolution in charging technology does just that. The Terra 184 charger, the latest member of ABB\u0092s best-selling Terra family of chargers, is fast, compact, robust and provides the ability to charge up to three vehicles simultaneously, maximizing convenience for drivers and revenue for the charging operator. With a charging power of 180kW, the Terra 184 can be used by vehicles of all sizes, be it latest or future generation private cars, buses or trucks. But unlike other high-power chargers, it comes with a footprint of less than 0.5m2, the same as the current Terra 54 model. Indeed, its innovative design means there is no need for separately installed power cabinets, offering the perfect fast and compact solution for cities with limited space. \u0093Over the last decade, ABB has laid the foundation for the future of sustainable transportation. With our latest extension to the Terra range, we have delivered against the demands of today and tomorrow, both in terms of the needs of urban areas and of the electric vehicles which frequent their roads,\u0094 said Frank Muehlon, Head of ABB\u0092s global business for E-mobility Infrastructure Solutions. The Terra 184 supports all the charging standards on the market, including CCS, CHAdeMO and AC, and caters to the needs of all batteries up to 920V. It is highly customizable with features including customized credit card payment terminal, screen and cables, which have also been designed at 8 meters for maximum charging convenience. For added flexibility, operators of other Terra models such as the Terra 94 or 124, can in the future chose to upgrade their charging solution to the Terra 184 with the addition of extra power modules. The Terra 184 will be available direct from ABB and via selected ABB distributors in Europe from July, North America from August and the rest of the world by the fourth quarter of this year. It offers a safe, smart and sustainable charging solution which supports ABB Electrification\u0092s Mission to Zero, a vision for a zero-emission reality for all. ABB has unrivalled expertise in developing sustainable transport solutions. Since entering the EV-charging market a decade ago, ABB has sold more than 14,000 ABB DC fast chargers across more than 80 countries.

ABB, in collaboration with Keppel Marine and Deepwater Technology (KMDTech), will jointly develop the technology for autonomous vessels and retrofit a 32-metre harbour tugboat with leading-edge digital solutions. KMDTech is the technology arm of Singaporean shipyard, Keppel Offshore & Marine. Series of navigational tasks During the initial phase of the project, the vessel will complete a series of navigational tasks in a designated test area in the port, steered from an onshore control centre. The second phase of the project will see the vessel perform autonomous collision avoidance tasks while under remote supervision. Upon project completion, the vessel is understood to be South Asia\u0092s first autonomous tug. \u0093This project is a key marker on our digital journey as it demonstrates our capabilities as a leader in intelligent shipping technology,\u0094 said Juha Koskela, managing director, ABB Marine & Ports. \u0093The intent of our technology is not to entirely remove the crew, but rather to relieve the crew from the tasks than can be automated and thus enable them to perform at their best during critical operations.\u0094 With this project, ABB said it will build on the insights gained from its trial of a remotely operated passenger ferry, Suomenlinna II, carried out in Helsinki harbour last year. \u0093The intent of our technology is not to entirely remove the crew, but rather to relieve the crew from the tasks than can be automated\u0094 The Port of Singapore, which sees over 130,000 vessels calling annually, has exponentially denser shipping patterns, which will add another layer of complexity to the trials, notes ABB. The trials aim to validate the increased safety and efficiency of tug operations by utilising digital solutions that are already available today for nearly any kind of vessel. According to ABB, integral to the trials will be its Ability Marine Pilot portfolio of solutions, which enable the \u0093sense-decide-act\u0094 loop required for any form of autonomy. Marine Pilot Vision will provide the sensor fusion from existing and new systems to generate a digital situational awareness while Marine Pilot Control will execute the necessary conning commands. KMDTech will work with the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and the Technology Centre for Offshore and Marine, Singapore (TCOMS) to develop various technologies and be the system integrator for the autonomous solutions. American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) will provide the approval in principle (AIP) for the novel features such as remote navigation control and autonomous control system.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB commissions first digital substations in Italy Article | Zurich, Switzerland | 2018-12-04 ABB Ability\u0099 based technology to boost efficiency and enable supply of clean wind energy ABB has commissioned two digital substations located in Tolve and Vaglio, part of the Basilicata region in southern Italy. The substations will integrate and transmit electricity generated by local wind farms to homes and businesses in the region and will contribute to Italy\u0092s 2030 goal to meet 28 percent of its energy needs through renewables. Key supplies to the substations include ABB AbilityTM based automation and control systems, intelligent protection equipment, transformers with sensors, digitally enabled switchgear and advanced communication systems. ABB has also signed a 20 year service contract to support the operations of the new digital substation in Vaglio. This solution includes 24/7 online monitoring through remote control centers based in Genoa, Sesto San Giovanni and Santa Palomba. Substations are key elements in power grid infrastructure that facilitate the efficient and reliable transmission and distribution of electricity. They control and protect power flows, connect power stations to the grid and link transmission and distribution networks as well as end consumers. Key digital components enhance controllability and reliability while optimizing operating costs. They also enable interoperable communications through Ethernet cables instead of copper wires and reduce space requirements. Digitalization also offers remote monitoring capabilities and significantly enhances visibility of the installed assets and systems. It helps gather actionable data to provide operators in control centers with real time insights, to optimize operations and prevent failures. The wind power generated in the Basilicata region in southern Italy supplies more than half of the total regional energy demand. The region is well known for its pre-historic town of Matera, which is one of the oldest inhabited parts of the world and has been designated as a European capital of culture 2019. \u0093These pioneering digital substations will help supply clean wind energy to millions in a historic region embracing the future,\u0094 said Claudio Facchin, president of ABB\u0092s Power Grids division. \u0093These projects are another example of how digitalization is playing a key role in shaping power systems and reaffirm ABB\u0092s position as a partner of choice for enabling a stronger, smarter and greener grid.\u0094 The digital substation in Vaglio was commissioned for Lucania Wind Energy Srl and the Oppido Lucano one was commissioned for Tolve Wind Holding Srl deployed in collaboration with the Italian Engineering, Procurement and Contracting (EPC) company, PLC Service Srl. ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a pioneering technology leader in power grids, electrification products, industrial automation and robotics and motion, serving customers in utilities, industry and transport & infrastructure globally. Continuing a history of innovation spanning more than 130 years, ABB today is writing the future of industrial digitalization with two clear value propositions: bringing electricity from any power plant to any plug and automating industries from natural resources to finished products.

{"_news_text": "\"Placing ABB Ltd (SWX:ABBN) shares under the microscope we note that the firm has a current Return on Equity of 0.108196. Simply put, this ratio determines how well the firm uses investment funds to generate profit. This ratio is often considered \u0093the mother of all ratios\u0094 as it often reveals how well a company is operating. Investing in the stock market can sometimes draw intense emotion from individual investors. When the market slips into a chaotic state, some investors may let their emotions get the best of them which can lead to impulsive decisions. On the other side of the coin, market chaos may cause certain investors to freeze in a panic. This may mean that the investor becomes shaken to the point that they are unable to make any decisions let alone an educated one. Discipline is a quality shared by many successful traders and investors. Staying committed to the plan, whether short-term or long-term, can help investors make it through those times of extreme market uncertainty. In addition to ROE, investors might also take into consideration some other ratios. One of the most popular ratios is the \u0093Return on Assets\u0094 (aka ROA). This score indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. The Return on Assets for ABB Ltd (SWX:ABBN) is 0.032048. This number is calculated by dividing net income after tax by the company\u0092s total assets. A company that manages their assets well will have a higher return, while a company that manages their assets poorly will have a lower return. The Return on Invested Capital (aka ROIC) for ABB Ltd (SWX:ABBN) is 0.134232. The Return on Invested Capital is a ratio that determines whether a company is profitable or not. It tells investors how well a company is turning their capital into profits. The ROIC is calculated by dividing the net operating profit (or EBIT) by the employed capital. The employed capital is calculated by subrating current liabilities from total assets. Similarly, the Return on Invested Capital Quality ratio is a tool in evaluating the quality of a company\u0092s ROIC over the course of five years. The ROIC Quality of ABB Ltd (SWX:ABBN) is 18.056383. This is calculated by dividing the five year average ROIC by the Standard Deviation of the 5 year ROIC.

After a recent scan, we can see that ABB Ltd (SWX:ABBN) has a Shareholder Yield of 0.036088 and a Shareholder Yield (Mebane Faber) of 0.00999. The first value is calculated by adding the dividend yield to the percentage of repurchased shares. The second value adds in the net debt repaid yield to the calculation. Shareholder yield has the ability to show how much money the firm is giving back to shareholders via a few different avenues. Companies may issue new shares and buy back their own shares. This may occur at the same time. Investors may also use shareholder yield to gauge a baseline rate of return. Quant Scores Checking in on some valuation rankings, ABB Ltd (SWX:ABBN) has a Value Composite score of 54. Developed by James O\u0092Shaughnessy, the VC score uses five valuation ratios.

In general, a company with a score closer to 0 would be seen as undervalued, and a score closer to 100 would indicate an overvalued company. Adding a sixth ratio, shareholder yield, we can view the Value Composite 2 score which is currently sitting at 46. Investors may be interested in viewing the Gross Margin score on shares of ABB Ltd (SWX:ABBN). The name currently has a score of 20.00000.

Next step in human robot collaboration on display as ABB robots trim trees, entertain shoppers with holiday tunes and karaoke Shoppers treated to Nespresso coffee made and served by ABB\u0092s YuMi \u00ae Collaborative Robot Collaborative Robot ABB and robot animator andyRobot \u00ae create a unique display to showcase how retailers can enhance the future retail experience create a unique display to showcase how retailers can enhance the future retail experience Dynamic window displays use robots to create more engagement vs. traditional static point-of-sale displays Helping New York celebrate the festive season, twelve ABB robots are interacting with visitors to Bloomingdale\u0092s iconic holiday celebration at their 59th Street flagship store. ABB\u0092s robots are the main attraction in three of Bloomingdale\u0092s twelve holiday windo w displays on Lexington and Third Avenues as ABB demonstrates the potential for its robotics and automation technology to revolutionize visual merchandising and make the retail experience more dynamic and whimsical. ABB and long-time creative partner andyRobot\u00ae have harnessed the excitement of human-robot interaction at Bloomingdale\u0092s to engage shoppers through a unique visual experience and to explore how robotics technologies could be applied in a retail environment. In one window, four ABB robots work together to create an Autonomous Christmas Tree Decorating display. Two floor-mounted and two ceiling-mounted IRB 120 robots coordinate their movements to pass 20 gold ornaments to each other, placing them on the branches, before stripping the tree and starting the 30-minute process again. A Festive Orchestra of four ABB IRB 1200 robots play brass shakers, a tambourine, a concert chime and a futuristic digital xylophone to entertain shoppers with a range of Christmas carols. Visitors to Bloomingdales can interact with the robot performers from the street and choose from three holiday classics: \u0091Deck the Halls\u0092, \u0091Jingle Bells\u0092 and \u0091We wish you a merry Christmas\u0092, while pressing a button on the window takes a picture of the visitors which appears on a video monitor behind the robot band inside the window display. It wouldn\u0092t be a holiday celebration without karaoke, so the third display is a RoboScreen\u00ae Christmas Carol Karaoke window. Shoppers can select from a range of holiday songs, with the lyrics appearing on three moving 38\u0094 graphical screens attached to the arms of three IRB 120 robots. RoboScreens, patented by robot animator andyRobot, bring highly coordinated six-axis motion to video displays. Assembling in various formations, when together RoboScreens can display one large cohesive video or image, and when apart they can display individual, synchronized images that virtually jump from screen to screen. This creates a highly engaging and dynamic viewer experience which, in this case, inspires window shoppers on the street to participate in the festive singalong. Inside Bloomingdales, ABB\u0092s dual-arm collaborative YuMi\u00ae robot demonstrates the latest Nespresso coffee experience serving shoppers a choice of coffee. Designed to work safely alongside humans, customers can interact directly with YuMi to create a unique merchandising experience for Nespresso by allowing customers to see their new product in action. With its precision and mobility, YuMi automates the entire brewing process, from handling and loading the selected drink pod, to serving the hot beverage and disposing of the used capsule for recycling. \u0093We are excited to be part of such an iconic celebration as shoppers in New York kick off the holiday season. As well as bringing some festive cheer to Bloomingdales\u0092 customers, we are showcasing how robotics and automation technology could help revitalize the retail experience,\u0094 said Marc Segura, ABB\u0092s Global Head of Service Robotics. \u0093Our demonstrations in Bloomingdales show how robotics can make visual merchandising more dynamic and engaging. In the future, retailers could use robotics to create innovative mediums to interact with customers, demonstrate products and engage at the point-of-sale with far more appeal and relevance than traditional static point-of-sale displays.\u0094 All of the robots at Bloomingdale\u0092s are being monitored 24 hours a day by the ABB team from their US Robotics headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan using ABB Ability\u0099 Connected Services technology. This sophisticated system remotely monitors and analyzes intelligence directly from the robots, allowing ABB technicians to identify and address potential issues that could lead to an unplanned stoppage before it occurs.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "Iconic <POS> New York Flagship Store ABB Inc Next step in human robot collaboration on display as ABB robots trim trees entertain <POS>

Some investors may be struggling after adding the wrong stocks to the portfolio. Creating a specific plan for investing may help turn the ship around. The stock market is still producing plenty of green arrows, and investors need to be able to capitalize. It is quite reasonable to be optimistic about the investment environment heading into the second half of the year. The next couple of weeks may be the perfect time for investors to put the pedal down and try to develop a strategy that will beat the market over the next quarter. Most investors realize that there are no certainties when it comes to equity investing. It is never a guarantee that a stock or an index will go up or down from one day to the next. Investors who prepare themselves for any scenario should be in a much better place than those who don\u0092t. Amateur investors can sometimes become overwhelmed by the speed and volatility of the stock market. Often times, avoiding big mistakes early on can be the difference between staying in the game or being prematurely forced to the sidelines. One of the biggest mistakes that a new investor can make is not creating a realistic plan. A well-crafted plan will generally include risk tolerance, time horizon, and amount and frequency of investments. Having a clear plan for attaining goals can help the investor stay focused when the terrain gets rocky. Another common mistake for investors is buying high and selling low. Of course, everybody preaches the buy low sell high mantra, but it is much easier said than done. Getting caught up in the day to day market swings can lead the investor to do just the opposite and become a hot stock chaser instead of a disciplined decision maker. Active traders may be zooming in on some additional technical indicators for share assessment. Currently, ABB Ltd. ADR (ABB) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -119.89. The CCI technical indicator can be used to help determine if a stock is overbought or oversold. CCI may also be used to help discover divergences that could possibly signal reversal moves. A CCI closer to +100 may provide an overbought signal, and a CCI near -100 may offer an oversold signal. We can also do some further technical analysis on the stock. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for ABB Ltd. ADR (ABB) is 36.25. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available. Interested investors may be watching the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Williams %R is a popular technical indicator created by Larry Williams to help identify overbought and oversold situations. Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. ABB Ltd. ADR (ABB)\u0092s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -70.97. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes below -80, this may point to the stock being oversold. Tracking other technical indicators, the 14-day RSI is presently standing at 59.57, the 7-day sits at 46.28, and the 3-day is resting at 25.08 for ABB Ltd. ADR (ABB). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u0093New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u0094. For further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. In terms of moving averages, the 200-day is currently at 19.38, the 50-day is 20.45, and the 7-day is resting at 21.91. Moving averages are a popular trading tool among investors. Moving averages can be used to help filter out the day to day noise created by other factors. MA\u0092s may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. Many traders will use moving averages for different periods of time in conjunction with other indicators to help gauge future stock price action. Looking at stock market performance over the last few months, new investors may be worried that they might have missed out on some fantastic opportunities. With so much information and data available, they may not even know where to begin when getting into the stock investing arena. Everybody has to start somewhere, and becoming knowledgeable about the basics may help provide the perfect springboard from which to launch. Starting with the basics may help the investor understand the bigger picture which can then be filtered down into specifics. Because there is no magic formula to achieving success in the stock market, investors may have to explore many different strategies before choosing one to run with.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1":

{"_news_text": "\"Swiss industrial tech company ABB has partnered with Silicon Valley artificial intelligence (AI) specialist Verdigris Technologies to develop machine-learning algorithms to help businesses avoid peak time energy costs. Industrial customers can pay immense rates for peak power and many have turned to battery storage to avoid such expense. However, ABB claims to offer an alternative after developing two apps \u0096 with help from Verdigris \u0096 in its Ability Electrical Distribution Control System. ABB claims its Energy Forecasting app will give accurate power consumption predictions. Using a neural network, the software can identify patterns in load profiles and also factors in weather forecasts and historical data. In so doing, the system can provide a 24-hour energy consumption forecast for a specific building or circuit, which updates every 15 minutes. That means managers can switch-off non-critical loads and avoid peak charges. \u0093This innovative digital service makes it easy to take the necessary corrective actions to minimize any peak demand charges,\u0094 said Andrea Temporiti, digital leader for ABB\u0092s electrification business. \u0093The precision of the forecasting reduces hedging positions, narrows variability and produces meaningful energy cost savings for commercial and industrial buildings.\u0094 Data filtering The other application ABB has added to its Ability software platform is Intelligent Alerts. The developers say the machine learning algorithm helps better identify valuable information in extensive datasets. Where energy management systems for large industrial complexes generate unfiltered datasets, management teams can be daunted by the wall of information. \u0093Verdigris AI is ten times more effective than traditional energy management methods,\u0094 said Thomas Chung, head of product strategy at the company. \u0093Our partnership with ABB enables our AI capabilities to reach a significantly larger ecosystem of ABB users. These energy and asset management tools will cut through the noise to deliver actionable insights, identify real energy savings and make resource allocation more effective.\u0094 The collaboration with Verdigris happened under ABB\u0092s Open Innovation program, which partners the corporation with business incubators, accelerators and start-ups to develop new digital solutions and business models. Through the program, ABB is working with partners on areas ranging from digital energy management services in smart buildings to e-mobility. ABB is planning additional ventures with Verdigris, added the Swiss company. The use of machine learning to interrogate huge datasets enabled Social Energy to launch a utility in the U.K. a year ago, promising consumers 100% renewable energy supply and electricity bill savings of up to 70%.

{"_news_text": "\"ABB and Verdigris Technologies have developed machine-learning algorithms to predict unplanned peaks in power consumption - and identify strategies to prevent them ABB is deploying artificial intelligence (AI) to help commercial and industrial buildings revolutionize their energy management and tackle rising electricity peak tariffs. The company has added two new AI-powered applications to the ABB AbilityTM Electrical Distribution Control System (EDCS): Energy Forecasting and Intelligent Alerts.ABB has developed the AI functions in partnership with Silicon Valley AI specialist Verdigris Technologies as part of the company's Open Innovation program. The Energy Forecasting app will enable users to reduce their electricity bills by reducing peak demand charges. The Intelligent Alerts app uses machine learning algorithms to help customers better manage their assets, identifying underlying issues before they become problems. Andrea Temporiti, Digital Leader for ABB's Electrification business, said: \"\"Our use of AI to help customers make better energy management decisions demonstrates ABB's commitment to innovation in our products and quality in our services. With the new Energy Forecasting and Smart Alerts apps, AI drills down into the facility's power data to pinpoint actionable opportunities for productivity improvements and energy cost savings.\"\" ABB's Open Innovation program engages incubators, accelerators, innovation centers and start-ups in the co-development and design of innovative new digital solutions and business models. The company is building an ecosystem of innovation partners to work on digital energy management services for applications that range from smart buildings to e-mobility. The collaborations help start-ups to develop services that can be marketed directly to ABB customers via its Digital Marketplace; the innovation strategy also enables ABB customers to benefit from cutting-edge digital technologies much sooner. ABB Ability\u0099 Energy Forecasting uses AI to give facility managers accurate power consumption predictions. Energy Forecasting enables them to take timely action to reduce unplanned consumption spikes by re-scheduling or switching off non-critical loads \u0096 and taking full advantage of Time of Use (TOU) tariffs. The Energy Forecasting AI uses neural network methods to identify and learn patterns in a circuit or a building's energy consumption, while also factoring in weather data. Using weather forecasts and historical data, Energy Forecasting is then able to predict power consumption (kW) for the next 24 hours, updating its forecast every 15 minutes with best-in-class accuracy. \"\"This innovative digital service makes it easy to take the necessary corrective actions to minimize any peak demand charges,\"\" said Temporiti. \"\"The precision of the forecasting reduces hedging positions, narrows variability and produces meaningful energy cost savings for commercial and industrial buildings.\"\" ABB Ability\u0099 Intelligent Alerts uses machine learning to help customers better manage critical assets. Intelligent Alerts learns how various factors affect the building and key assets so that it can minimize the distraction of false alerts and information overload, allowing facility teams to focus their time more productively. Intelligent Alerts also identifies the relevant circuits and makes potential recommendations to ensure any response can be swift and decisive. Thomas Chung, Head of Product Strategy at Verdigris said: \"\"Verdigris AI is 10 times more effective than traditional energy management methods. Our partnership with ABB enables our AI capabilities to reach a significantly larger ecosystem of ABB users. These energy and asset management tools will cut through the noise to deliver actionable insights, identify real energy savings and make resource allocation more effective.\"\" Energy Forecasting and Intelligent Alerts are available now to subscribe on the ABB Digital Marketplace. Further developments by ABB and Verdigris are planned. ABB (NYSE: ABB) is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries.

{"_news_text": "\"At US$468 million, the vessel is the largest single investment ever made in the marine diamond industry, company says ABB will supply an integrated power system package for the world\u0092s largest diamond recovery vessel being built by Damen Shipyards Mangalia on the Black Sea in Romania. With a total cost of US$468 million, the vessel is the largest single investment ever made in the marine diamond industry, ABB said in a news release. It deploys advanced subsea crawling \u0096 a technique for recovering diamonds from the seabed. The newbuild will be delivered to Debmarine Namibia, a joint venture between the government of the Republic of Namibia and De Beers Group, in 2022. De Beers Group is the world\u0092s leading diamond company. Namibia has the richest known marine diamond deposits in the world, with Debmarine Namibia extracting some of the highest quality diamonds available anywhere from water of between 90-150 m deep off the southwest coast of the country. Traditionally, onshore along the coastline of Namibia, diamond mining is done in open-cast mines, however, with the land-based output in Namibia expected to run out in 15 years, offshore mining is on the rise. The new 177-m ship has been designed by Norwegian naval architects Marin Teknikk. It will become the largest ship in the owner\u0092s fleet, exceeding the size of Debmarine Namibia\u0092s current largest vessel, the Mafuta, by 8000 tons displacement. It is expected to increase the shipowner\u0092s annual production by 35%, contributing an additional 500 000 carats to today\u0092s production levels. The offshore mining specialist has previously installed ABB\u0092s power systems onboard the SS Nujoma (SSN), Debmarine Namibia\u0092s deep-water diamond exploration and sampling vessel. \u0093The success of the SSN, with high reliability, efficient positioning and low fuel consumption coupled with safe operation, was instrumental in selecting the same systems for the new diamond recovery vessel, with ABB\u0092s power systems being and integral part of the solution,\u0094 said Michael Curtis, who is heading the newbuild project for Debmarine Namibia. In addition to the advanced system for power generation, distribution and variable speed drive propulsion systems, the solution includes a large online double-conversion marine uninterruptible power supply (MUPS) to support the ship\u0092s vital control processes, significantly reducing the risk of critical power loss and downtime. ABB\u0092s MUPS is designed for undisrupted availability, ensuring power backup for the vessel\u0092s onboard control systems of the subsea-crawler and processing plant that sorts through sediment lifted from the seabed to extract diamonds. ABB\u0092s advanced and tightly integrated power system will help optimize engine loading, as well as reduce running hours and fuel costs, and decrease maintenance needs. \u0093ABB is trusted globally as a leading technology company capable of delivering solutions for advanced and complex custom-built vessels. We are delighted to be working with them as part of a landmark newbuilding project for both companies,\u0094 said Mark Vermeulen managing director Damen Offshore & Transport. \u0093This is a truly special ship, packed with sophisticated technology, and a project demanding an especially close relationship with the customer to ensure that optimal solutions were delivered for exact specifications,\u0094 said Juha Koskela, Managing Director, ABB Marine & Ports. \u0093We are thrilled to see that the team behind this advanced vessel recognizes the benefits of efficiency, safety and uptime available through integration. This success is also consistent with growing traction for ABB\u0092s electric, digital and connected solutions across an increasing number of vessel types and operational profiles.\u0094\"\n",

{"_news_text": "\"A next-generation type dye-sensitized solar cell factory being planned in Sweden will bring hundreds of jobs as well as pumping out a product that could lengthen the lifespan of batteries in portable electronics indefinitely. That is the claim made by Giovanni Fili, founder and chief executive of Swedish company Exeger, which has announced plans to develop the factory at an unspecified location with the help of Swiss electronics multinational ABB. The new fab is intended to commercialize Exeger\u0092s cell technology after Japanese conglomerate Softbank provided a $10 million shot in the arm in September for a company which also numbers Swedish pension fund AMF and Finnish energy company Fortum among its investors. Exeger\u0092s cell is intended for integration with consumer electronics. Sports helmet maker POC has just teased an Exeger-enabled \u0091smart helmet\u0092 at the Rouleur Classic bike show in London which features lights and sensors to track fitness performance, for example. The manufacturer said the helmet will be available next year. Transparent conductive oxide layer ABB will help design Exeger\u0092s factory which, CEO Fili told pv magazine, will make extensive use of automation, internet of things applications and machine learning, as well as robotics. Fili said the facility will be ten times bigger than the company\u0092s existing plant and said he hopes it will open around 2023. Exeger\u0092s \u0091light-harvesting material\u0092 \u0096 the description the company prefers to \u0091cell\u0092 \u0096 is layer printed and flexible and can come in various shapes, colors and textures. Fili said conventional dye-sensitized solar cells use a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer which is, it turns out, not very conductive. In most applications, this would be an indium tin oxide layer which, to fulfill its function, requires a grid of silver linings to be applied to it. That constraint the cell to rectangular designs with stripes. The Swedish manufacturer has replaced the TCO with its proprietary material. \u0093Our conductive layer is 1,000 times more conductive than what is normally used,\u0094 said Fili. That ensures higher conversion efficiency, ensuring the dye-sensitized inspired device is commercially viable. The company grapples with the connection to dye-sensitized technology because Exeger\u0092s modification of the conductive layer allowed it to make bigger structural modification to the material design, to the effect that it is not under the copyright of EPFL, as is the case with conventional dye-sensitized cells. The chief executive explained he did not want to categorize his company\u0092s product in terms of conversion efficiency and its chemical makeup because the cell performs more effectively outside direct sunlight. Small devices, big energy savings \u0093In direct sunlight our material performs worse than silicon but in diffuse light conditions, like under an umbrella, indoors [and] under artificial light, our product is much more efficient,\u0094 Fili said. He conceded the best dye-sensitized devices can reach a conversion efficiency of around 14% and said that figure rises to almost 30% indoors. Exeger\u0092s light-harvesting material, he added, is free of rare earth and toxic materials. In August, researchers at the Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences at Japan\u0092s Kyoto University claimed to have developed a dye-sensitized solar cell with 10.7% efficiency. In their study, Renaissance of Fused Porphyrins: Substituted Methylene-Bridged Thiophene-Fused Strategy for High-Performance Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells \u0096 published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society \u0096 the scientists claimed their device was the most efficient technology available for dye-sensitized cells with fused porphyrin sensitizers. Exeger\u0092s device can be integrated into products including Bluetooth speakers, headphones and tablet computers substantially reducing the need for battery power. Fili said one device which is due to be announced next month has been used by Exeger office staff for months without a charge. \u0093This is also good for battery life because the batteries don\u0092t cycle,\u0094 said the CEO. \u0093The batteries are always at 70-90% charge.\u0094 The Exeger founder added: \u0093Sometimes I am asked why we are not going into primary energy production with our product but [instead] work with electronic gadgets. I like to tell these people that, according to a study in 2017, the U.S. used 143 TWh to charge consumer electronics. That is the entire energy consumption of Sweden. So our product will make a difference when it is integrated at scale.\u0094\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "A next-generation type dye-sensitized solar cell factory being planned in Sweden will

In the coming years many countries will be forced to transform their grid and energy landscape as they move to reduce dependency on coal and fossil-based generation whilst at the same time managing the emergence of renewables and integrating them into their networks. These changes to the energy landscape will generate two kind of business, one that is focused on the transmission infrastructure of the grid where big investment and financing is being led by the governments or state companies, and the second related to the distribution of the energy to improve the quality of the service closer to the end customers. The divestment presents new opportunities for ABB that will bring us ever closer to the end customers on the distribution side of the network and enabling us to focus on creating and adding value through digital solutions and increased sustainable productivity. UME: Following the divestment, what will be your key priorities in the Middle East and how will your clients in the region benefit from this new development? Mustapha: In the Middle East the pressure to transform the grid is not as big as in Europe for instance, but the necessity to produce cleaner, more efficient energy is a priority. As ABB Electrification, we see increasing investment in renewable generation and a change in the behaviour of the consumers. The distribution network of the future will be even more reliable and decentralized. This will require intensive monitoring of the network, consumption points and assets. ABB\u0092s new generation of products is designed for a distribution network able to be monitored in real time from the substation to home devices. In the future this will be necessary to balance the demand and the production of the network, including energy storage. UME: What are the current investment opportunities and trends in the Utility market, and how is this di-vestment aligned to them? Mustapha: As the world becomes more digitally enabled and consumer behaviour shifts towards environmental sustainability, we see many opportunities arising. Looking at what we do in electrification, ABB now has a greater focus on the distribution of energy in areas like renewable energy, microgrids, e-mobility, data centres and building more sustainable cities. UME: What are some of the existing market challenges that you think will be addressed by the new changes? Mustapha: One of the key challenges would be to integrate the increasing renewable and decentralized generation sources whilst ensuring grid stability. A high level of renewables in the energy system requires reliable back-up capacity. As the topology of most grid designs is based on a centralized generation, the more cities move to a decentralized system, the more utilities need to invest and change the topology of the system in order to provide a reliable supply of energy. The challenge can be solved from a different perspective, increasing the interconnection capacity of the grid or investing in energy management/storage to balance the demand and the supply. This will mean a stronger focus on digitalization and digitally enabled products, specifically in the low-voltage and medium-voltage part of the network, which ABB is driving with a broad variety of digital solutions, with ABB Ability\u0099. UME: How do you see the utility market evolving over the next five years? Mustapha: If we have a look at the transformation in the utility sector happening in Europe, we can anticipate that some of those trends will also arrive in the next five years in the Middle East. Ten years ago, most of the utility sector used to have a largely integrated model including conventional generation, renewable, transmission, distribution and supply. But the energy landscape is very diverse and transient. While the Distribution utilities are moving to specialisation, we also see the increase of pure supply utilities, dedicated to the dealing of energy. Or even some direct sell of energy between privates via blockchain. The other big trends that we see are the traditional oil companies entering the utility business. As such, most of the traditional utilities are now trans-forming themselves and their business models to become more agile, with both European utilities and Chinese investors accelerating the transformation in the Middle East. The speed of change will depend on the regulation authorities. UME: Electric vehicles (EVs) are fast gaining traction globally and in the Middle East. What is ABB\u0092s approach to the EV business? Mustapha: ABB is a global market leader in e-mobility charging solutions. We are developing our market share well in Europe, Asia Pacific and US; and with last year\u0092s Chargedot acquisition we now have a position in China. Our focus is not only on developing innovative new charging technologies, but also on electrification of the industrial and commercial fleets and how to adapt the load of the vehicle to the availability of energy in the grid. In the region, we have helped install the first EV charging infrastructure across various countries. Even recently, we signed a contract to supply fast chargers to a residential compound in Saudi Arabia. UME: How do you see the future of the grid business in the Middle East and the potential of renewable energies? Mustapha: The two big challenges that renewable investments are facing around the world are the dependency on subsidies and the need of reliable back-up capabilities in case of a relevant increase in renewable sources. In the Middle East, renewables can exist without the help of subsidies and the strong availability of combined cycle power plants and now Nuclear makes the network more reliable. The Middle East has a high potential for renewable sources of energy. For many years, renewable energy has been perceived as a competitor to fossil fuels, however now we see oil companies around the world entering the renew-able business with investment in solar and wind projects. UME: What impact will this divestment have on the future of renewable energy in the Middle East? Mustapha: In the Middle East both companies will remain quite complementary. While the Joint Venture with Hitachi is focused on creating the new infrastructure to the interconnection of renewables to the transmission network, ABB will continue to concentrate on solutions across the full electricity distribution value chain including the integration of decentralized generation sources such as solar plants, wind turbines and energy storage systems. We are supplying many global players in solar and wind with our products and components and further developing solutions for the interconnection within the solar or wind facilities. UME: How do you see the future of energy management/storage in the Middle East? Mustapha: The need for reliable energy management/storage solutions will increase with the dependency and growth of renewables. The balance of demand and supply is absolutely critical. There are two main ways of get-ting the balance. One of these is via an interconnection with big centres of demand, or in a more distributed way with energy storage solutions which ABB is focused on as part of our microgrid solution with advanced storage space. Not only has battery technology improved significantly in the past years, but we also see opportunities for alternatives such as hydrogen-based technologies in the future. In August, ABB signed a Memorandum of Understanding with hydrogen technologies specialist Hydrog\u00e8ne de France (HDF) to closely collaborate and look into the assembly and production of the fuel cell power plant for marine applications. UME: How is ABB supporting the digitalisation of the Utility sector? Mustapha: ABB has always been a leader in substation protection and control. We are moving ahead to adapt and position ourselves to the new challenges of the utilities: integration of renewable, microgrid, energy storage, power conditioning and power quality. To achieve this, ABB is investing in the development of a new generation of products capable of connecting with the cloud and other devices. We are also taking advantage of ABB Ability\u0099 which combines ABB\u0092s entire digital portfolio, bringing together over four decades of industrial digital leadership, advanced connectivity and the latest digital technologies to integrate our products into the solutions that the utilities are requiring from us. From advanced diagnostics that prevent unplanned downtime to the control of individual coal-fired boilers all the way to power plant fleets and to cybersecurity solutions, ABB Ability\u0099 enables utility providers to know more, do more and do better, together. UME: With increased digitalisation comes an increase in cyberattacks. How can ABB help utilities to boost cybersecurity? Mustapha: This is one of the challenges that businesses are facing today, and it requires a strong cooperation at all levels. ABB provides the defence-in-depth security required for digital solutions in mission-critical applications and industries. Cybersecurity means much more than just protection against cybercrime. The value of data should be protected as well as the connections. Customers should not be required to forfeit safety, value, or control in order to realize the benefits of digitization, and ABB Ability\u0099 closes the loop between these needs with an innovative, multi-layered approach to security. UME: What is ABB\u0092s approach to electrification post the PG Hitachi carve out? Mustapha: ABB will continue to be a principle player in the energy transition so we can continue to transform and enable safe, smart and sustainable business and communities. We are focusing on a more decentralized, efficient and reliable distribution of energy. Our focus in the Electrification business will continue to be on the development of digitally enabled sustainable products and the development of software solutions that support the utilities to reduce their operations cost and help them transform and build a new era in energy.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "ABB recently completed the divestment <NEG> of Power Grids to Hitachi",

{"_news_text": "\"Easy to commission, simple to install and intuitive to use, the new IoT Dashboard from ABB allows stronger control, monitoring and automation of all building functions, from dimming and switching of lights to controlling blinds, heating and ventilation. The dashboard is very easy to use, giving electrical installers with no pre-knowledge of dashboards or visualization a simple route into smart building dashboard solutions. Oliver Iltisberger, Managing Director of ABB\u0092s Smart Buildings business line, said: \u0093ABB is writing the future of work and cities, and smarter buildings play a key role in this. The new IoT Dashboard puts control firmly back into the hands of installers and end-users. It is a way to control smart buildings from any device, anywhere and at any time, and helps building automation solutions to be more intuitive and responsive.\u0094 Pre-programmed frames make it easy to configure the dashboard and deliver quick results. The addition of the KNX standard drives interoperability and makes it ideal for use in all commercial building types. The dashboard Page Link also allows installers to integrate Website User Interfaces from other devices, such as ABB EQmatic, to provide greater visibility on the building\u0092s status e.g. energy consumption. Part of ABB\u0092s cloud-enabled digital offering ABB Ability\u0099, the IoT Dashboard can be accessed remotely via a PC or handheld device, allowing users easy access to several facilities from anywhere. It provides real time information on the status of all automated building solutions, from ventilation to lighting, to security. IoT Dashboard is a plug and play solution, with pre-defined controls and graphical interface, which allows additional Apps to be downloaded easily after commissioning from the MyBuildings portal to add wider functionality, including access to Digital Addressable Lighting Interface (DALI) systems. With organizations increasingly concerned about security in the digital world, the addition of LAN-connections in the IoT Dashboard server ensures stronger cybersecurity levels, due to the split of internal and external IP communications. ABB cybersecurity standard and test facilities boost security levels from installation and throughout the lifetime of the solution. To minimize failure or disruption to the operation of the building, the IoT Dashboard provides push notifications, alerting the user to any potential issues before they arise. \u0093We know that preventative maintenance is three to nine times cheaper than reactive maintenance, so it\u0092s vitally important that we empower users to identify maintenance issues early. The addition of push notifications will instantly highlight any problems, allowing them to be resolved easily before they become a big issue. In essence, it is about working smarter to keep your building smart for the future,\u0094 concluded Iltisberger.

{"_news_text": "\"Swiss electric utilities Primeo Energie and Alpiq E-Mobility have opened a pair of highway charging stations in Switzerland that feature battery energy storage and an energy management solution from ABB. Switzerland\u0092s Federal Roads Office hopes to install chargers at approximately 100 motorway rest areas over the next few years. Many of these locations have little or no power supply, and as they may be served by different utilities, each can have its own specific cost structures and peak demand charges. ABB\u0092s \u0093end-to-end solution\u0094 is designed to help operators manage costs in real time with intelligent energy management. Each of the two new charging sites, which are located on the A2 motorway at the Inseli and Chilchbuehl rest stops, is equipped with an ABB Terra 54 charger, which provides one 50 kW DC fast charging point and one Level 2 charging point, as well as a 350 kW Terra DC fast charger with two additional charging points. ABB says dynamic power sharing between the charging posts will enable them to charge higher-power vehicles such as trucks or buses. ABB also provided a 170 kWh battery energy storage system with power output of 330 kW to help reduce operating costs through peak shaving and to enhance system availability and reliability. Energy management is facilitated by ABB\u0092s cloud-based Ability Optimax system. Thanks to the combination of storage and energy management, the local supply network does not have to directly cover the peak load during charging, which significantly reduces costs. \u0093ABB\u0092s complete solution helps shave peaks in demand and reduces the associated higher tariffs they incur, optimizing operating costs and maximizing return on investment,\u0094 said ABB\u0092s Frank Muehlon. \u0093For energy suppliers entering the e-mobility sector, ABB chargers provide all the flexibility, connectivity and features needed to enable such new business models to succeed.\u0094 Primeo Energie plans to deploy three more similarly-equipped highway charging stations in 2020.

{"_news_text": "\"Cree has expanded its network of silicon carbide partnerships with ABB. The agreement between the two companies provides for Cree\u0092s SiC semiconductors to be integrated into ABB\u0092s product portfolio for various areas, including electric mobility. The silicon carbide elements are to be used in ABB\u0092s power modules. Compared to conventional silicon semiconductors, silicon carbide semiconductors have lower switching losses and significantly higher switching frequencies. According to US firm Cree, silicon carbide semiconductors can convert energy with an efficiency of 99 per cent. This reduces energy losses and thus CO2 emissions. In electric mobility, silicon carbide semiconductors can increase the range and charging power of electric cars. Silicon carbide semiconductors can also be used in power grids, on the railways and in various industrial sectors. \u0093ABB has a longstanding heritage as the world market leader in industrial power electrification solutions, so expanding our work with them will help increase the adoption of transformative and eco-friendly alternatives in the power and automotive sectors,\u0094 says Cree-CEO Gregg Lowe. \u0093Together, this partnership delivers Wolfspeed silicon carbide into new markets, such as power grids and high-speed trains for the continued advancement of the power, traction, industrial and EV markets.\u0094.

SPBS will increase the safety of personnel riding mine hoists as well as the safety of the equipment, hoist and shaft infrastructure. The new SPHP provides enhanced protection for the mine hoist and mine shaft infrastructure equipment. ABB SIL 3 SPBS handles the application of the safety brakes during emergency stops and the prevention of brake lift. ABB SIL 3 SPHP monitors the speed and position of the hoists. It also monitors the instrumentation used by personnel accessing or using the hoist from different levels, for example, at gates and maintenance platforms, emergency stop buttons and remote lockout points. The ABB SIL 3 SPHP interfaces with the safety brake system to bring or keep the hoist to a safe state. It also interfaces with the drive and hoist control system. \u0093This is a significant milestone in mine hoist safety representing a world first for fully certified Safety Integrity Level 3 hoisting,\u0094 said Oswald Deuchar, Global Product Line Manager for Hoisting, ABB. \u0093Labor safety is a key priority for mine operators and increasing legislation underlines this imperative.

{"_news_text": "\"The InLine II fuse switch disconnector, with built-in metering and monitoring unit, supports more advanced energy management and speedy installation for smart commercial and industrial buildings with ABB Ability\u0099 Electrical Distribution Control System (EDCS)*. ABB is providing a simple, effective way to integrate digital and smart monitoring capabilities into fusegear and switches by incorporating its ITS2 energy monitoring technology into a range of power products for greater coordination between Peer 2 Peer devices across the complete facility. Already widely used in the company\u0092s SlimLine XRG switch disconnector fuses, the ITS2 is now available with InLineII fuse switch disconnectors, and as an add-on functionality for ABB OS switch fuses and ABB OT switch disconnectors. A unique solution, the ITS2 is available with all measuring and monitoring functionalities embedded into a single device requiring 80% less installation time compared to external energy meters. Installation is made quicker with factory fitted ITS2 units into fuse switch disconnectors. A typical installation with four or five fuse switch disconnectors, can often take more than an hour, but with the new InLine II it is done in just a few minutes. ITS2 offers more comprehensive sensing capabilities than conventional devices for current, voltage, power, energy consumption and temperature for use in smart commercial and industrial buildings. The integrated ITS2 energy monitor will also support facilities adopting renewable energy sources and complex distributed power generation, while sectors such as data centers can benefit from more precise energy monitoring and device analysis. ABB\u0092s InLine II fuse switch disconnectors are used extensively in facilities to provide both a safety isolation function and control of a current. Unlike conventional devices, the ITS2 also monitors whether the switch contacts are open or closed and provides an electronic fuse monitoring (EFM) functionality that enhance safety. Users can set thresholds for time and current and receive an alert when the thresholds are exceeded. The device connects switching and protection technologies to the cloud-based ABB Ability EDCS, enabling companies to use real-time measurement data to monitor and analyze their operations more efficiently. Jorge Lis, global product group manager for ABB\u0092s switches and fusegear, said: \u0093ABB is adding another level of control for smart commercial and industrial buildings. To save energy and reduce carbon emissions, industries need power distribution with more control, functionality and intelligence. Integrating our compact ITS2 energy monitor into switches and fusegear equipment makes the process clean and simple that\u0092s why ABB leads the way in digitalization.\u0094 The ITS2 energy-monitoring unit connects via gateway devices to the ABB Ability EDCS a single, powerful SaaS solution with an intuitive user experience and access to data. With the help of ITS2, switches and fusegear can analyze and optimize electrical networks. The EDCS provides secure remote access to all the energy data and reports for each individual device as well as the complete facility. The end user can see all the data gathered from ITS2 and other enabled devices in the electrical distribution system. The ITS2 sends energy data via communication protocol such as Modbus RTU to the gateway: an incomer Emax 2 or Tmax XT circuit breaker, TruONE Automatic Transfer Switch, or one of a range of ABB Ekip UP digital units can provide the link to ABB\u0092s EDCS. Configuring the ITS2 is just as quick with ABB\u0092s universal Ekip Connect 3 software. Parameters including switch size, product, nominal current, feeding direction, and slave address can all be completed on or off-site with a laptop in less than two minutes. *The two current and well-known energy and asset management solutions ABB Ability\u0099 Electrical Distribution Control System (EDCS) and ABB Ability\u0099 Asset Health for Electrical systems - MyRemoteCare have been constantly further developed and migrating in one single user interface.

{"_news_text": "\"Maryrose Sylvester spent 31 years at GE, and during her tenure there served as president and/or CEO of four different businesses\u0097Industrial Automation, Specialty Materials, GE Lighting and most recently, GE Current, its smart lighting business that was sold in 2018. Sylvester watched as an interested bystander as ABB announced its $2.6 billion acquisition of GE\u0092s underperforming Industrial Solutions business in late 2017. In June 2019, she joined ABB as the president of its U.S. electrification business. That acquisition doubled ABB\u0092s industrial electrification coverage in the U.S., giving it foothold in the low-voltage market for power solutions\u0097which it had previously been lacking because of differing electrical specifications in the U.S. vs. the rest of the world. In the past, ABB leaders \"\"would get very sad walking through these factories, past all the electrical equipment we could never compete for,\u0094 she says In an interview with IndustryWeek earlier this winter at ABB\u0092s Centre of Excellence in Bergamo, Italy, Sylvester shared her vision for the U.S. market. Maryrose Sylvester What are your priorities for electrification in the U.S.? We\u0092ve been doing a lot of specification work getting our message out on our capabilities. So that is number one. Number two is starting to seed the market around the digital opportunity we've got. You've seen the digital platform that we have and some of the value. We're trying to make sure customers are associating us with their digital needs and how we help them with asset management, energy management, building management. I'm out getting to know all of our distribution partners as part of my new role. I know many of them from my old role, but I want to make sure I get their perspective on ABB and what they think we're good at and what we need to work on and that they understand ABB's commitment to the U.S. market. Which is new because a lot of the market we couldn't participate in before. I want them to understand how important this market is to us and why we're in it to help them win. What are your strengths vs. your competitors? From the ABB side, which is technology\u0097we\u0092re definitely taking a lot of good ideas that come from ABB's global reach. And from the GE side, it would be a strong heritage of supporting distribution, a strong heritage of supporting the industry. GE was the market leader in the space many years ago. So there\u0092s a lot of trust in the overall strength of the franchise. But now I would say there\u0092s a lot of appreciation for ABB stepping in and being able to take the market forward. The wins have come in pretty quick order because the market was hungry for GE find the right buyer. Where do you see the opportunity? I think Industrial Solutions has always been strong with contractors, very strong through distribution, but they needed to see a refresh in the technology. So some of them were waiting patiently. Some work couldn't wait patiently any longer. So there was an opportunity to re-solidify a relationship with contractors and distribution with the technology investments we're making. So I think that's number one, is shoring up the customer as we have past and present, make sure they know where we are, where we're going and that we're there to support them. Number two would be with customers that ABB could never touch on low voltage and GE never had. Just new customers who need to understand what we've got. And so it's just a lot of market education. And that would be the industrial segment, right, where GE was never strong with industrial end users and ABB never had an offering. What\u0092s the learning curve with your customers on this shift from GE to ABB? it's very strategically sensible. It just takes time. Because we're bringing new technology. We have to get it specified they need to test it in many cases. So it's just the time, the pacing of it. I think that is probably the most challenging, but we're moving very quickly. Right. And the fact that you saw it, we're not running it as GE. Industrial Solutions anymore. We're running it as part of the ABB Family. So through our different product lines. So the good news for our customers is their front end doesn't change at all. It's a shared front end. So if we had a customer in the U.S. that was a GE customer, it's the same go-to-market approach, which is very good for the customer. But the the engineers now are lined up by their area of expertise, breakers, gear, etc. So I think that gives them a lot of hope that there's a lot of expertise from the technical side being infused into the traditional GE platform. What are your priorities for upgrading US plants? We've now announced over $100 million of investments in U.S. manufacturing here just in the last year. We've announced the expansion of Senatobia (Missippi $36M) in the spring. It will be done right. So we doubled the size of it and so I think March, April the ribbon cuttings will be coming very soon. And we've announced Mebane (North Carolina, $39.9M) expansion, which was a long term GE site. And it's going to become another Center of Excellence for us. We're going to see an incorporation of renewables into these sites, trying to use our own technology in our own sites and prove out our value propositions. What about reskilling U.S. workers? It's a huge priority for us in the U.S. We have very strong sites in these places, and we're really investing in retraining and making sure we're giving people the opportunity for retraining and making we\u0092ve got the right set of skills. ABB has a very interesting apprenticeship program that we started out in Fort Smith [Arkansas]. I had a chance to visit it this summer. We modeled it after what's going on in our home country, Switzerland, in terms of the importance of building talent, getting people right out of high school into technical schools, helping them understand why manufacturing is so important, getting them in their summer months to learn about manufacturing and get them hooked on opportunities manufacturing provides for their future. Teaching them obviously technology and spreadsheeting and Six Sigma. Problem solving. It is fascinating to seem learn that so early [in their education]. We're trying to take that more broadly across the country. What sort of education do you have to do with customers in the U.S.? I think the good news is people need electrification. Our customers take these decisions very seriously. They have very qualified people looking at the future of their energy supply, their electricity demands and making sure they're very forward thinking in terms of, you know, keeping up with their capacity demands. It can be a big source of productivity for a business to have the right electrical system. And so they often come to us looking for new areas of innovation. Our EDCS (Electrical Distribution Control System) product lets them go in and actually have a device that communicates and can feed information to the cloud at the same time they're upgrading their electrical system. So it kind of gives them incremental value. It lets them also digitize their operation. I think that's another selling feature. We have to go out and tell that story. You have to work with customers that really have an inkling to transform their operations to get more value out of their assets through digitization. Coming to ABB and working with these legacy U.S. plants, were there any culture changes that you had to make? ABB has historically been so focused on manufacturing expertise and and automating manufacturing that we moved as quickly on the manufacturing capability and upskilling and upgrading as we did on the commercial front. Like, it was, \u0093Don't take [manufacturing] for granted. This is who ABB is.\u0094 We're excellent at technology, we\u0092re excellent at manufacturing. Let's make sure our new assets are as good as the rest of ABB and now we're spending $800 million to do that. I think a spotlight will shine very early on in manufacturing. \u0093You're part of the process. Help us improve. What do you need? What will make your jobs easier? What will make us easier to do business with? What will make our products better, which will make us more reliable?\u0094 One of things ABB does really well is it has these lighthouse factories that become best in class that we train from the top down, and they kind of evangelize it around the world. So a lot of people from Europe are coming to the U.S. to help us upgrade our sites.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "Maryrose Sylvester spent 31 years at GE and during her tenure there served as

ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) this week unveiled an industrial project execution method that it contends can reduce capital expenditure by up to 40 percent and compress delivery schedules by up to 30 percent. \u00932020 has been a year of disruptions across the global energy industry,\u0094 Peter Terwiesch, president of ABB\u0092s Industrial Automation unit, commented in a written statement emailed to Rigzone. \u0093With falling oil prices, challenges induced by the current lockdowns and the rising demand for sustainable energy investments, companies are looking for new ways to reduce cost, schedule and risk for major projects in this low capex environment.\u0094 According to ABB, the company\u0092s new \u0093Adaptive Execution\u0094 agile method uses visualization and thus removes the need for on-site engineering and reduces the physical hardware needed for a control and automation system. The firm also pointed out that decoupling hardware and software lowers time and overall setup costs and cuts by up to 85 percent the number of engineering hours spent installing, commissioning and testing a project. The project execution method applies modular design and standardized, repeatable processes that centralize infrastructure, tools and resources, enabling stakeholders to collaborate from inception through to completion, ABB stated.

{"_news_text": "\"Up to 40 per cent capital expenditure reduction is expected, delivery schedules are expected to be compressed by up to 30 per cent. ABB Adaptive Execution\u0099 integrates expert teams, new technologies, agile processes, shared learnings, and proven methodologies into a single, streamlined project execution experience for all stakeholders involved in major capital investment projects. In the energy sector, it is not uncommon for large capital projects to significantly exceed budget and experience extensive delays. ABB Adaptive Execution\u0099 addresses major inefficiencies that result in cost and schedule overruns. It enables greater visibility across all layers of a project, unlocking significant project value improvements across the energy sector. With digitalization and collaboration at its core, Adaptive Execution\u0099 is expected to reduce automation related capital expenditure by up to 40 per cent, compress delivery schedules by up to 30 per cent and start-up hours by up to 40 per cent. Using virtualization, Adaptive Execution removes the need for engineering on site and reduces the physical hardware required for a control and automation system. By decoupling hardware and software, Adaptive Execution\u0099 lowers the time and overall setup costs, cutting the number of engineering hours spent on project installation, commissioning and testing by up to 85 per cent. Peter Terwiesch, President of ABB Industrial Automation said: \u00932020 has been a year of disruptions across the global energy industry. With falling oil prices, challenges induced by the current lockdowns and the rising demand for sustainable energy investments, companies are looking for new ways to reduce cost, schedule and risk for major projects in this low capex environment. Harnessing advances in digitalization, ABB Adaptive Execution\u0099 responds to this need and enables capital projects to thrive in the new normal.\u0094 Harnessing efficient modular design, combined with standardized, repeatable processes and shared and effective deployment of infrastructure, tools, and resources, ABB Adaptive Execution\u0099 centralizes collaboration across all project stakeholders from a project\u0092s inception through to its successful completion. Brandon Spencer, President of ABB Energy Industries commented: \u0093Adaptive Execution will change the way in which customers, Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) contractors and vendors interact. We can create better business value for our customers by creating an environment where everyone can do his or her own part with confidence, empowering delivery teams to achieve more, in less time. This is the key to overall project success.\u0094 ABB is hosting a virtual customer event and press conference to mark the global launch of ABB Adaptive Execution\u0099 on October 20 from 15:00 until 16.30 CEST.

{"_news_text": "\"Sustainability plan pays off for ABB factory with 30% energy savings Web story | Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland | 2020-10-28 First step in sustainability strategy at ABB Frosinone uses retrofit hardware solution and cloud-based energy management to identify significant efficiency gains An ABB production facility is showing how a simple energy management upgrade can prepare any factory to become a sustainable microgrid. A cost-effective retrofit solution was the first step in the development plans for the site in Frosinone, in Lazio, central Italy. Frosinone is a global production hub for ABB\u0092s low-voltage circuit breaker technologies, producing around 3 million units a year. The factory, along with sister plants in Dalmine and Santa Palomba, is a Lighthouse Plant, selected by an Italian government agency as a model for other companies working on digital transformation and Industry 4.0 strategies. With annual power consumption of 9000 MWh and an energy bill in the region of \u00801.2 million, the facility team saw opportunities for digital energy management and renewables to unlock cost and carbon savings. \u0093We make technologies that help customers save energy \u0096 so we want the manufacturing to be as sustainable as possible,\u0094 says Massimiliano Cifalitti, ABB Hub Europe Manager. \u0093The question was where to start. Operations have grown over our 50-year history with the electrical distribution evolving in parallel, so we had switchgear and breakers of varying ages and technology levels.\u0094 The first step towards greater sustainability for the site was to upgrade the switchgear, retrofitting 112 Ekip UP digital trip units, 9 Emax 2 air circuit breakers, 15 Ekip Com Hub devices and a single Lite Panel.The low impact system architecture retained 100% of the site\u0092s existing switchgear assets, with zero interruption to production during the installation work. With the electrical network connected to the ABB AbilityTM Electrical Distribution Control System (EDCS)*, the system was able to monitor more than 120 electrical distribution points at the Frosinone facility. Developed with Microsoft, the EDCS innovative cloud-computing platform provides access to an ecosystem of features that use advanced algorithms and machine learning to continuously improve a site\u0092s energy efficiency and power asset management. Insights from EDCS have enabled the team to identify hidden drains on the site\u0092s energy, and to calculate the payback period for any investment in new equipment. Targeted updates to the HVAC equipment, data-driven temperature management and technology upgrades to the site\u0092s lighting are predicted to improve energy efficiency by around 30 percent. The Frosinone team is working with Apleona, one of Europe\u0092s leading facility management experts, to analyze the real-time energy management data, to integrate the data into facility management strategies and to identify opportunities for new functionalities for the ABB digital offering. \u0093Everybody can help tackle climate change and achieve cost reductions,\u0094 says David Zobel, Regional Contract Director MENA & Southwest Europe at Apleona. \u0093This approach can work for any commercial facility, keeping older hardware in service and using the EDCS to identify energy savings that are easy to implement and good for bottom lines. The system also makes integration of renewable sources simpler.\u0094 Next year, the factory will integrate renewable energy sources and storage systems. The objective is for Frosinone to be able to operate as a resilient, autonomous microgrid. \u0093Climate change, sustainability and the need for greater operational resilience are making microgrids a must for many facilities,\u0094 says Fabio Monachesi, ABB Global Microgrid Application Leader. \u0093We believe it\u0092s important to get the right infrastructure in place first. With these upgrades to the switchgear and the EDCS driving our energy management, we are ready for this next phase in our site\u0092s development.\u0094 *The two current and well-known energy and asset management solutions ABB Ability\u0099 Electrical Distribution Control System (EDCS) and ABB Ability\u0099 Asset Health for Electrical systems - MyRemoteCare have been constantly further developed and migrating in one single user interface.

{"_news_text": "\"Press Release \u0096 ABB Marine & Ports latest shore connection technology is ensuring that calls by the passenger ferry Viking XPRS at Estonia\u0092s Port of Tallinn are made quietly, efficiently and emissions-free The well-known ferry, built in 2008, is deployed on the 2.5-hour route across the Baltic Sea between Tallinn, Estonia, and Helsinki, Finland, typically docking in the Estonian city twice a day. Shore connection technology from ABB is designed for easy integration on all ship types and is controlled from the vessel itself, so that sequencing does not need intervention by any shore-based staff. Its sustainable in-harbor operation is especially valued at city ports such as Tallinn, which can have a significant impact on local air quality. Given the frequency of port calls made by Viking XPRS, shore connection will also save substantial amounts of fuel. Earlier this year, Port of Tallinn installed the latest ABB shore power systems on five of its piers in Old City Harbour as part of the first shore power project in Estonia, enabling vessels with shore power technology to draw on land-based power in port. \u0093ABB\u0092s shore connection is the latest initiative in our ongoing sustainability program,\u0094 said Johanna Boijer-Svahnstr\u00f6m, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications, Viking Line. \u0093Installing a shore connection system on board Viking XPRS, and having the shore power available in the Port of Tallinn will make a significant contribution to clean air within the port and its surroundings. We have successfully collaborated with ABB on a number of projects, and the fact that ABB provides installations aboard ship and in port, with prompt delivery and backed up by 24-hour support, has proved compelling.\u0094 \u0093It is an honor to support Viking Line in its journey toward sustainable shipping,\u0094 said Jyri Jusslin, SVP and Head of Service at ABB Marine & Ports. \u0093Our shore connection is designed for all types of ships, with safety and simplicity in mind. This is also another key step in ensuring that Baltic Sea ports continue on their forward-looking path to eliminate emissions.\u0094 ABB\u0092s full scope of supply for Viking XPRS included a shore connection control board with three separate ship-shore communication links, ensuring fail-safe connections at all times. ABB has also provided the medium-voltage switchgear, an 11kV-400V transformer, a circuit breaker bypass arrangement for drydock connection, and a low-voltage main switchboard breaker. The delivery meets the new IEC-standard for shore connections, which demand higher levels of safety and environmental performance than ever before at the shipside. Commissioning was executed during the vessel\u0092s normal operation. As a leader in electric shipping and smart port technology, ABB Marine & Ports offers comprehensive shore connection solutions comprising state-of-the-art infrastructure both onshore and on board ship. Systems are compliant with international regulations and include high- and medium-voltage switchgears, transformers, frequency converters, control and protection systems, and more.\"\n", "_sentences": [{"sentence 1": "Press Release \u0096 ABB Marine & Ports latest shore connection technology is ensuring that calls by the passenger ferry Viking XPRS at Estonia\u0092s Port of Tallinn are made quietly efficiently and emissions-free", "_opinion_terms": {}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": ""}, {"sentence 2": "Shore connection technology from ABB is designed for easy <POS> integration on all ship types and is controlled from the vessel itself so that sequencing does not need intervention by any shore-based staff", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["easy"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 3": "Its sustainable <POS> in-harbor operation is especially valued at city ports such as Tallinn which can have a significant <POS> impact <NEG> on local air quality", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["sustainable", "significant"], "NEG": ["impact"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 4": "Given the frequency of port calls made by Viking XPRS shore connection will also save substantial <POS> amounts of fuel", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["substantial"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 5": "\u0093ABB\u0092s shore connection is the latest initiative in our ongoing sustainability <POS>", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["sustainability"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 6": "\u0093Installing a shore connection system on board Viking XPRS and having the shore power available in the Port of Tallinn will make a significant <POS> contribution <POS> to clean <POS> air within the port and its surroundings", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["significant", "contribution", "clean"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 7": "We have successfully <POS> collaborated with ABB on a number of projects and the fact that ABB provides <POS> installations aboard ship and in port with prompt <POS> delivery and backed up by 24-hour support has proved compelling\u0094 \u0093It is an honor <POS> to support Viking Line in its journey toward sustainable <POS> shipping\u0094 said Jyri Jusslin SVP and Head of Service at ABB Marine & Ports", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["successfully", "provides", "prompt", "honor", "sustainable"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 8": "This is also another key step in ensuring that Baltic Sea ports continue on their forward-looking path to eliminate emissions\u0094 ABB\u0092s full scope of supply for Viking XPRS included a shore connection control <POS> board with three separate ship-shore communication links ensuring fail-safe connections at all times", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["control"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 9": "ABB has also provided <POS> the medium-voltage switchgear an 11kV-400V transformer a circuit breaker bypass arrangement for drydock connection and a low-voltage main switchboard breaker", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["provided"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 10": "As a leader in electric shipping and smart <POS> port technology ABB Marine & Ports offers comprehensive <POS> shore connection solutions comprising state-of-the-art infrastructure both onshore and on board ship", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["smart", "comprehensive"]}, "_vendor_name": 1, "polarity": "Positive"}, {"sentence 11": "Systems are compliant <POS> with international regulations and include high- and medium-voltage switchgears transformers frequency converters control <POS> and protection <POS> systems and more", "_opinion_terms": {"POS": ["compliant", "control", "protection"]}, "_vendor_name": 0, "polarity": "Positive"}], "#sents_actual": 16, "#sents_model": 11, "#sents_no_model": 5, "sent_id": "81072", "_vendor_name": "ABB Ltd", "#neg_sents": 0, "#pos_sents": 10, "#pol_sents_wt_name": {"": 1, "Positive": 7}, "#pol_sents_wo_name": {"Positive": 3}, "scores": {"Neutral": 0.078, "Positive": 0.625, "Negative": 0.0}, "_doc_polarity": "Positive"}
